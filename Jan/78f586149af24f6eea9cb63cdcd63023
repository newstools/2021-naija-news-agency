French youth international Guendouzi left north London ahead of the transfer deadline in October, making the move to Bundesliga outfit Hertha for the 2020/21 campaign. The 21-year-old’s exit of course came with Guendouzi having slipped majorly down the pecking order at the Emirates over the final months of last season. He was accused of taunting several Brighton stars over finances during a defeat at the Amex back in June, and had since failed to garner a single appearance. As such, with Mikel Arteta having made abundantly clear that he is not afraid to completely freeze out members of his Arsenal squad (just ask Mesut Ozil), Guendouzi’s eventual exit did not come as much of a surprise. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1195399077-1024x833.jpg" alt="Video: Arsenal’s Matteo Guendouzi continues stellar form with fine Hertha opener"/> ST ALBANS, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 22: Arsenal Head Coach Mikel Arteta with Matteo Guendouzi during a training session at London Colney on December 22, 2019 in St Albans, England.

The youngster has featured in the club’s last 9 league outings, playing all 90 minutes versus the likes of Augsburg, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Levekusen. He even opened his account in the colours of Die Alte Dame last month, putting his side in front with a classy finish at Borussia Monchengladbach: Arsenal loanee Matteo Guendouzi balling in the Bundesliga  pic.twitter.com/AbcfKkOOGk — ESPN FC (@ESPNFC) December 12, 2020 And, as outlined above, Guendouzi’s recent renaissance continued this afternoon, versus Schalke. Hertha welcomed the Bundesliga basement dwellers to the Olympiastadion, for the club’s first outing of the new year. The hosts eventually emerged from the clash with a comfortable 3-0 victory, climbing up to 12th in the table in the process. And, as outlined above, it was their young midfield loanee who set Hertha on their way, with his 2nd goal of the campaign. After seeing the ball drop kindly at his feet just inside the Schalke area, Guendouzi quickly adjusted his feet, before bending a superb strike into the far corner of the visitors’ goal: Mattéo Guendouzi gets @HerthaBSC_EN on the board with this marvelous curl.  pic.twitter.com/uavdcJYyed — Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) January 2, 2021 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
