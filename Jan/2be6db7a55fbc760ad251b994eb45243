And also co-produced it. Nothing wrong in using song writers if you write song for me and I like am I go sing am. https://t.co/WWwaH3NQAH — Runtown (@iRuntown) December 30, 2020 This statement from Runtown crediting himself for writing Aye, however, contradicts Davido himself who in a video, emphatically credited producer Tspize for solely writing and producing the record.
