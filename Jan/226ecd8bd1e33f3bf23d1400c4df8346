Arsenal would secure Nicolas Pepe’s services in the summer of 2019. The Gunners snapped the Ivorian up for a club-record £72m on the back of the winger enjoying a sensational campaign in Ligue 1 with Lille. Since making the move to north London though, Pepe hasn’t come close to producing the exploits that made him such a desirable target in the first place. In fact, Pepe has been so underwhelming that Mikel Arteta has actually spent much of this season playing an out of form, aging Willian on the right-wing instead of Pepe. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1284623317.jpg" alt="Crystal Palace’s Zaha claims he had positive conversation with Unai Emery over Arsenal switch: ‘We’d love to have you’"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 08: Nicolas Pepe of Arsenal during the Premier League match between Arsenal and Aston Villa at Emirates Stadium on November 08, 2020 in London, England.

Former Gunners boss Unai Emery has previously stated that he wanted to sign Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha instead of Pepe. And now Zaha himself has spoken out over his potential Arsenal switch on the latest episode of the Greatest Game podcast. Zaha claims to have held positive talks with Emery, in which the Spaniard stated they would love to have him. The still Palace man also said that he would love to have made the move to the Emirates: “I had a conversation with the Emery, he was like ‘yeah we’d love to have you’ and I was just like ‘yeah I’d love to come. Obviously, it was up to the club who they chose. And they chose Pepe over me.” ”Emery was just like we don’t really need to go through much. He said he’d seen me play, he knows I can change games at any time and stuff like that. The conversation was rather straight forward, he saw what I could do, saw my work-rate, and what I could add to the team.” Episode 11 of Series 2 out now!This week, @Carra23 speaks with @CPFC star @wilfriedzaha Available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you get your podcasts!  https://t.co/kGcN2VIcfG pic.twitter.com/ejO34QzqYC — Greatest Game (@GreatestGamePod) January 7, 2021 See also: Aston Villa vs Liverpool betting tips: FA Cup preview, predictions & odds Stoke City vs Leicester City betting tips: FA Cup preview, predictions & odds Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
