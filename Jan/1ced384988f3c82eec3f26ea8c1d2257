The Gunners of course headed into proceedings with spirits high in the club’s camp, on the back of a timely upturn in form. Following a 7-game winless streak in the English top-flight, Arsenal bounced back with a 3-1 downing of Chelsea last weekend, before putting Brighton to the sword by a solitary goal during the week. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picture16-1-1024x707.jpg" alt="LONDON, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 26: Bukayo Saka of Arsenal celebrates after scoring his team&#039;s third goal during the Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Emirates Stadium on December 26, 2020 in London, England.
