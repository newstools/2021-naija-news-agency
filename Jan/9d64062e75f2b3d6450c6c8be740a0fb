The first surrounds Eric Garcia. Manchester City defender Garcia is a product of the famed La Masia academy in Catalunya, but departed his boyhood club for England in 2017. The 19-year-old, despite his tender years, has since gone on to thoroughly impress when handed the chance by Pep Guardiola, establishing himself as one of the most highly regarded young defenders in Europe. As such, though he remains behind the likes of Aymeric Laporte, Ruben Dias and the rejuvenated John Stones in the pecking order at the Etihad, it nevertheless came as a major blow for all associated with City when word was forthcoming that Garcia had come to the decision not to renew his expiring contract: ‘He has one more year and after that, he doesn’t want to extend’, explained Guardiola. ‘We want it but he doesn’t want to, so I imagine he wants to play in another place.’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1190728103-1024x699.jpg" alt="Barcelona transfer latest: ‘Total agreement’ with Eric Garcia/Raiola responds to Haaland deal claims"/> Manchester City’s Eric Garcia Manchester City v Sheffield United – Premier League – Etihad Stadium 29-12-2019 .
