Judikay keeps the message simple and direct. She employed the Gospel folk music of Eastern Nigeria to give it that old-time religion impression, the level of seriousness the message requires. "The worst part of hell is the absence of anything good," Judikay posited. "Everything good, everything God will be gone."

Confess that you believe in HIS substitutionary sacrifice for you and that you receive HIS life. Heaven is real! Your heaven can begin now in Jesus because this is infallible truth. Jesus is coming!" "Behold I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown" – Revelation 3:11 "As you dance and are blessed by this timeless sound, remember JESUS IS COMING again and your soul is my business!" She concluded.
