By Ralph O-kobz Nigeria’s starboy and global pop icon, Wizkid has got mouths wagging after making remarks regarding “his wedding” on Instagram. <img src="https://notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/images-1-630x420.jpeg"/> The comment was made the 31st of December 2020 on a post by Patoranking on Instagram. The ‘abule’ singer uploaded a video of his rendition of the tune on the Hennessy artistry live stage and this tickled and presumably got Wizkid excited and he made a plea wishing for the song to be played on his wedding day. <img src="https://notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201231-162653_Word-640x305.jpg"/> The pair were recently seen in Ghana having a good time together with friends and it’s also worthy of note that Wizkid endorsed ‘abule’ as the hardest jam of the year via a tweet on his official Instagram page.
