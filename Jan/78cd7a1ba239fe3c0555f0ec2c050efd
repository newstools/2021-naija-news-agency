Arsenal want Mesut Ozil to pay them €10m to allow him to complete a January move to Turkish side Fenerbahce, according to reports. The German has been heavily linked with a move away from the Emirates Stadium during the last two transfer windows and has not played for the north London side since March last year. He took part in a Twitter question and answer session on Monday and dropped plenty of hints about his next destination, with Fenerbahce and DC United reported to be among the teams leading the chase for his signature. FEATURE: One per club: The exhaustive list of the exhausted… With only six months left on his terms with the Gunners, the 32-year-old was asked if he will continue his career when his contract at Arsenal runs out. Ozil replied: “I definitely will. There are two countries I want to play football in before I retire: Turkey and USA. If I went to Turkey, I could only go to Fenerbahce.” Fenerbahce seems the most likely option with rumours almost every day that a deal could be close to completion. FotoSpor (via Sport Witness) claims Fenerbahce chiefs are travelling to London on Tuesday to speak with Arsenal over a possible deal for Ozil. The Turkish website reckons that Ozil wants the Gunners to pay him a severance package worth €10m that is owed to him for the remainder of his contract, with the German wanting it ‘paid in two years’. However, it is understood that Arsenal are requesting the same amount from Ozil for the last six months he has remained at the club and not played. The report concludes by saying: ‘The 20 million euro difference between the requests of the two parties prevents Mesut from leaving London.’ The post Arsenal want Ozil to pay them €10m to complete transfer appeared first on Football News –.
