It is fair to say that Liverpool have been one of the sides to have suffered most during the early months of this strange, Covid-19-hit season. The majority of the Reds’ woes have come on the injury front, particularly at the back. Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez have, of course, been ruled out for lengthy periods. Combine this with Joel Matip’s persistent fitness issues, and Liverpool have been left extremely light defensively. This, in turn, has forced Jurgen Klopp to call on Fabinho, Jordan Henderson and a number of young stars to help fill the void at the heart of his backline. As such, it hasn’t come as too much of a surprise to see the Merseysiders linked with several centre-backs over the last few months. Liverpool were tipped to swoop for Schalke stopper Ozan Kabak in December. Reports stemming from France at the back end of last month, meanwhile, suggested that Klopp and co. were interested in Lille star Sven Botman. Botman, who is only 20 years of age, joined French outfit Lille from Ajax over the summer. The stopper had little senior experience to his name before this season, having made his way through the youth ranks of the Dutch champions. Despite his inexperience, though, Botman has taken to Ligue 1 like a duck to water, playing a key role in Lille’s early-season success. In turn, as mentioned above, a further update surrounding Liverpool’s rumoured pursuit of the centre-half has this weekend emerged online. As per a report from the Mirror, citing Duncan Castles, the Reds have ‘stolen a march’ on their Premier League rivals in the race for Botman’s signature. It is added that Jurgen Klopp and co. believe they could seal a deal for the Lille standout for around £15m.
