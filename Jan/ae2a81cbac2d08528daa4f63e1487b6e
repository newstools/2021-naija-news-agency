The Blues are set to get their FA Cup campaign underway on Sunday evening. Lampard’s men will welcome League Two outfit Morecambe to Stamford Bridge, with hopes of getting their campaign back on track. Chelsea have of course endured a dismal couple of weeks form-wise, slipping off the pace of not only the Premier League title race, but also the top-4. This comes with the capital giants having secured just a solitary win from their last 6 outings in the English top-flight. The latest of these came as perhaps the most concerning, with a meeting with Manchester City in southwest London last weekend having seen the mammoth gap between the sides at present laid bare, en route to a 3-1 defeat for the hosts. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-1294299768.jpg" alt="James, Kante &amp; more: Frank Lampard provides Chelsea team news update"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – JANUARY 03: Frank Lampard, Manager of Chelsea looks on during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Manchester City at Stamford Bridge on January 03, 2021 in London, England.

And, as outlined above, ahead of his side’s meeting with Morecambe, Frank Lampard this afternoon held his pre-match press conference. A number of topics were brought to the fore during the presser, the most noteworthy of which came in the form of the latest on the fitness of the Blues’ squad. Lampard first went on to confirm that Reece James, who has been struggling with a hamstring injury of late, will play no part in 48 hours’ time: ‘I am not going to talk about the starting line-up for Morecambe but Reece James is out of the game although he will be training with us tomorrow, but the game comes too early.’ And the news was not much better when it came to Andreas Christensen and N’Golo Kante, both of whom will also be unavailable for selection: ‘The same as Andreas Christensen and N’Golo Kante, who is out also with a minor hamstring injury so he misses this game and he is suspended for Fulham next Friday anyway. So we will get him right.’ When pressed further on Christensen’s problem, Lampard added: ‘The injury was absolutely from that moment in the Villa game and there was probably a typical modern-day reaction where Andreas took stick for it, but he is out injured.’ ‘The injury isn’t too bad which is good news so he will be back training with us tomorrow.’ #ICYMI Frank Lampard previews the Morecambe clash, plus reports on those unavailable for the @EmiratesFACup clash — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) January 8, 2021 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
