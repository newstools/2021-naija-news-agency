In response to the ill-mannered tweet, Simi clearly expressed her disdain for the comparison. She wrote; “"Why are they hiding their baby?"because some of you people are fucking sick and deserve slaps everyday. No boundaries. No sense. Disgusting POS. From Simi’s response, it's obvious celebrities intentionally hide their new born kids from the media to circumvent incidents like this. "Why are they hiding their baby?"because some of you people are fucking sick and deserve slaps everyday. No boundaries. No sense. Disgusting POS. https://t.co/4ZdVAVSfCq — Simi (@SympLySimi) January 2, 2021 The post Simi Blasts A Child Critic On Twitter appeared first on Most Trusted Voice in Music & Afrobeats from Nigeria & Africa | Notjustok.
