With the economy being the way it is, several people are trying their hardest to do legitimate businesses and things can be either very slow to kick off or too expensive to market properly. This is our way of letting YOU share your hustle with the world. How It Works Please Note: **Other Ts&Cs apply The competition for this month opens NOW and will close on the 14h of January.
