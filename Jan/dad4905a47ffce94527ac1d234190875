For the first time in some time, things are of course beginning to look up for Mikel Arteta and co. This comes with Arsenal having brought to an end a spell of dismal recent form with back-to-back wins over the course of the last week. First, the north Londoners welcomed capital rivals Chelsea to the Emirates, eventually emerging with a thoroughly deserved 3-1 victory. And this was followed by a hard-fought 3 point-haul at the Amex on Tuesday, when Arteta’s men downed Brighton by a solitary goal. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1293643283-1024x679.jpg" alt="Partey, Saka &amp; more: Arsenal provide team news update ahead of West Brom"/> BRIGHTON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 29: Alexandre Lacazette of Arsenal celebrates with teammate Bukayo Saka after scoring his team’s first goal during the Premier League match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Arsenal at American Express Community Stadium on December 29, 2020 in Brighton, England.

The Gunners are set to make the trip to the Hawthorns, for a meeting with West Brom. The Baggies will head into proceedings in 48 hours’ time in search of a bounce-back performance, having bizarrely followed up an impressive 1-1 stalemate at Anfield with a 5-0 defeat at home to Leeds. As such, though they will enter the clash with spirits high, Arsenal will be fully aware of the threat posed by a West Brom side out for revenge, and battling for their top-flight lives. In turn, Mikel Arteta will, for obvious reasons, be hopeful of having as many of his key performers available as possible at the Hawthorns. It has therefore come as a major boost to hear that Bukayo Saka will be available for selection, after shaking off an issue picked up at the Amex on Tuesday: Sustained heavy impact to his left leg during Tuesday’s match against Brighton, but has been in training since and available for selection. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Picture16-1-1024x707.jpg" alt="LONDON, ENGLAND - DECEMBER 26: Bukayo Saka of Arsenal celebrates after scoring his team&#039;s third goal during the Premier League match between Arsenal and Chelsea at Emirates Stadium on December 26, 2020 in London, England.
