The Pensioners returned to action a short time ago, in the marquee fixture of the Premier League weekend. Chelsea welcomed Manchester City to Stamford Bridge, in search of a much needed bounce-back display. Lampard’s men had managed just a solitary win in their last 6 across all competitions prior to the clash, a run which had seen the capital giants slip off the pace of not only the title race, but the top-4, too. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1293498502-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chelsea board ‘looking at alternatives’ to Frank Lampard as tensions rise in Blues squad following City defeat"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 28: (l – r) Mason Mount, N’Golo Kante,Jorginho, Cesar Azpilicueta and Edouard Mendy of Chelsea appeal to to match referee, Stuart Attwell after Aston Villa’s first goal scored by Anwar El Ghazi (Not pictured) during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge on December 28, 2020 in London, England.

A frankly embarrassing first-half performance on the part of the hosts allowed an admittedly superb City to race out to a 3-goal advantage within the opening 35 minutes. After Ilkay Gundogan opened the game’s scoring, Phil Foden added a Citizens 2nd just minutes later, before Kevin De Bruyne’s neat finish all but killed off any remaining hope of a Chelsea comeback. 4 – Kevin De Bruyne has now scored four goals against Chelsea in the Premier League; the most a former player has netted against the Blues in the competition.

A series of reports to have surfaced online on the back of the final whistle in the capital this evening have pointed towards a potential change at the helm at Chelsea. In fact, as per reliable outlet The Athletic, the Pensioners board have already begun looking into potential replacements for Frank Lampard. This comes for a host of varying reasons, stemming beyond the poor recent spell of form overseen by the inexperienced tactician. The higher-ups in southwest London are said to be increasingly concerned by Lampard’s inability to get the best out of his players, in particular big-money summer additions Kai Havertz and Timo Werner. The Chelsea boss is also rumoured to be losing his grip on the dressing room, amid mounting tensions with high-profile members of his first-team squad.
