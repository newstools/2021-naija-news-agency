Mikel Arteta’s men welcomed the Magpies to north London a short time ago, for the opening fixture in the defence of their FA Cup crown. The capital giants of course entered proceedings with their tails up, on the back of a timely upturn in form of late. On the back of 7 straight outings without a Premier League win, Arsenal rattled off a trio of consecutive victories over the last couple of weeks, the latest of which saw them make short work of West Brom last weekend. Newcastle, on the other hand, were winless in six, a stretch which included four defeats, and an exit from the League Cup at the hands of Brentford. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/GettyImages-1196967678-1024x683.jpg" alt="Arsenal 2-0 Newcastle: Tierney continues to stand out, but unsung hero Xhaka the real game-changer"/> NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLAND – JANUARY 01: Steve Bruce, Manager of Newcastle United looks on during the Premier League match between Newcastle United and Leicester City at St. James Park on January 01, 2020 in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.

When all was said and done, however, Arsenal required all of 120 minutes to scrape past a game Newcastle side. An altogether forgetful 90 minutes of normal time so nearly produced a telling moment right at the death, only for Bernd Leno to save the hosts’ blushes, with a tremendous double save: HUGE from Leno #EmiratesFACup @Arsenal pic.twitter.com/3uklmja0MJ — Emirates FA Cup (@EmiratesFACup) January 9, 2021 And the German’s heroics proved telling upon the clash rolling into extra-time, as a pair of late strikes eventually guided Mikel Arteta’s holders into the FA Cup’s last-32. First, a quick exchange on the edge of the Newcastle area saw Alexandre Lacazette nod into the path of substitute Emile Smith Rowe, who made no mistake with a pinpoint finish into the far bottom corner of Martin Dubravka’s net: Smith Rowe #EmiratesFACup @Arsenal pic.twitter.com/Cco2lubArn — Emirates FA Cup (@EmiratesFACup) January 9, 2021 Then, with just minutes remaining, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang got in on the act, netting just his 2nd goal in 8, on the back of yet more fine work down the left courtesy of Kieran Tierney: You already know Aubameyang loves an #EmiratesFACup goal for @Arsenal  pic.twitter.com/PnaiBke6sH — Emirates FA Cup (@EmiratesFACup) January 9, 2021 On the back of proceedings coming to a close at the Emirates, there is not a whole lot to discuss when it comes to standout performers. The clash, all told, proved a disappointing one, with few having truly impressed over the course of the 120 minutes. One who did continue to shine, despite the general lack of quality, however, was Kieran Tierney. Scottish stopper Tierney has emerged as one of Arsenal’s most important players of late, with his lung-busting runs up and down the left flank having proven central to the upturn in form being enjoyed by the Gunners.. And tonight proved no different, with the former Celtic man having looked equally impressive at both ends of the pitch, acting as the hosts’ main source of creativity over lengthy stretches. He was eventually rewarded with the assist for Aubameyang’s result-clincher, with Tierney’s ever-growing influence perfectly summed up by the statistic showcased below: Five chances created in one game is the joint most by an Arsenal player in a single game this season, although of course tonight Tierney has benefitted from extra time. https://t.co/IYhORw3NX5 — Orbinho (@Orbinho) January 9, 2021 Tierney, whilst no doubt the Man of the Match in the eyes of most, though, did not actually prove the deciding factor in Arsenal’s eventual victory. The flow of the clash in fact largely turned in the favour of the hosts on the back of the introduction of Granit Xhaka. Oft-maligned midfielder Xhaka completely changed the tempo of the hosts’ play after replacing Joe Willock, opening Newcastle’s defence up with pinpoint passing on numerous occasions. One such delivery set Tierney free to tee up Aubameyang late on, after Bukayo Saka had wasted another opportunity set up by Xhaka with a heavy first touch shortly beforehand. He also forced a fine stop out of Dubravka with a dipping volley in extra-time, all told, simply adding some much needed quality to Arsenal’s ranks in the middle of the park. The 28-year-old, for reasons which do not require delving into, will of course never be a favourite amongst the Gunners faithful. However, on his day, and in the right system, Xhaka remains a more than capable player, who should stand as the favourite to join Thomas Partey in Mikel Arteta’s midfield upon the Ghanaian’s return over the weeks ahead.
