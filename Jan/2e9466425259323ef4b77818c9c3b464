Widespread media chatter has of course surrounded the future of Chelsea stopper Tomori over the course of the last week. This comes with the English international having fallen majorly down the central defensive pecking order at Stamford Bridge this season. Tomori now sits behind of all of first-choice pairing Thiago Silva and Kurt Zouma, Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger in Frank Lampard’s list of options at the heart of his side’s backline. In fact, to this point in the campaign, the 23-year-old has not been afforded a single Premier League start. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1184351479-1024x656.jpg" alt="How Fikayo Tomori’s AC Milan switch could help Chelsea to land Dayot Upamecano"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 23: Chelsea’s Fikayo Tomori during the Premier League match between Manchester City and Chelsea FC at Etihad Stadium on November 23, 2019 in Manchester, United Kingdom. (Photo by Rich Linley – CameraSport via Getty Images) As such, speculation pointing towards a January departure from southwest London for Tomori has come as little surprise. The Chelsea youth product remains highly regarded in most circles, and possesses all of the characteristics to develop into a potentially top-class stopper. And one club who have long reportedly been keen to take advantage of his difficult situation at Chelsea are AC Milan. The Rossoneri are in need of reinforcement at the back amid their surprise challenge for the Serie A title, with Tomori, if the latest word stemming from the media over the last 48 hours is to be believed, now on the verge of making the move to the San Siro: Fikayo Tomori is set to join AC Milan from Chelsea. The agreement is expected to be completed next week on loan with buy option [*no* obligation] around €30m. Tomori will fly to Milano in the next few days. Here we go soon.  #CFC #ACMilan https://t.co/4FDzDY7uh3 — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 17, 2021 As outlined above, though, whilst Tomori’s exit, whether just temporarily or on a permanent basis, may weaken Chelsea’s options at the back for the time being, it could also prove significant in their hopes of securing superior additions in the summer. Milan’s move for the Englishman actually only comes with the Italian table-toppers having missed out on a deal for no.1 target Mohamed Simakan. The 20-year-old Strasbourg defender is viewed as one of the finest young talents in his home country, making the Diavolo’s interest understandable. However, despite reportedly tabling multiple bids late last year, the board at the San Siro were repeatedly knocked back by their Strasbourg counterparts, opening the door for another suitor to step up. The outfit in question? RB Leipzig. As confirmed by numerous sources over the weekend, Simakan has now agreed to the personal terms of a contract with Leipzig, ahead of a potential move to the Red Bull Arena: According to Sky Germany Mohamed Simakan agreed to join RB Leipzig. Personal terms are agreed. The two clubs still have to agree on the final fee and an official bid is expected soon. @Sky_MaxB — Francesco Porzio (@fraporzio95) January 14, 2021 Such an addition to Julian Nagelsmann’s squad, though, would actually only come with Leipzig having accepted the fact that one of their own crop of impressive stoppers – in the form of Dayot Upamecano – is primed to move on. It is of course widespread knowledge that Upamecano is highly sought after across Europe, with a host of the continent’s top clubs having been tipped as potential landing spots for the Frenchman at one point or another. In turn, should Simakan arrive, either this month or in the summer, the stage will be set for a transfer to finally come to fruition for his fellow countryman. And Chelsea, who, whether inadvertently or not, have aided Leipzig’s move for Simakan by sending Tomori to Milan, are expected to be at the front of the queue for Upamecano, come the season’s end: Chelsea are battling Bayern Munich to sign RB Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano, but Bayern are currently leading the race, according to TZ. #CFC #FCBayern #RBL — Ronan Murphy (@swearimnotpaul) January 12, 2021 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
