Much of the media chatter surrounding ongoings at the Emirates of late has of course centered on former German international Ozil. This comes with Mikel Arteta having doubled down on his efforts to freeze the ex-Real Madrid man out of his first-team setup this season. Upon Spanish tactician Arteta taking the reins in north London late last year, Ozil’s initial experience actually proved quite positive. The 32-year-old was afforded a consistent string of starts by his new boss, suggesting that he was set to prove central to the plans of Arteta moving forward. Bizarrely, however, since football’s return on the back of the initial Covid-19 outbreak during the summer, Ozil has not received a single minute of playing time. Arteta, meanwhile, has made crystal clear that this situation is unlikely to change any time soon, through a pair of high-profile calls. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg" alt="Amid mounting claims of imminent Arsenal exit, Mesut Ozil drops major Fenerbahce hint"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 15: Per Mertesacker and Fredrik Ljungberg of Arsenal look on as Mesut Ozil kicks his gloves in the air in frustration after he is subbed during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Manchester City at Emirates Stadium on December 15, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

And this was swiftly followed by news that the gifted midfielder had also not been afforded a place in the Gunners’ 25-man Premier League panel. Arsenal’s Premier League squad in full.

Nevertheless, the widespread assumption has long remained that, with Arteta likely to be handed until at least the end of the season to fully prove himself, Ozil’s career in north London is all but over. And, in turn, speculation in the media has begun to mount of late that a January exit could be on the cards. Murat Zorlu, a member of congress at Turkish heavyweights Fenerbahce, recently went as far as to suggest that a winter move to the Super Lig had emerged as a near certainty for the Arsenal man. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1179184163-1024x683.jpg" alt="Amid mounting claims of imminent Arsenal exit, Mesut Ozil drops major Fenerbahce hint"/> LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND – OCTOBER 30: Mesut Ozil of Arsenal during the Carabao Cup Round of 16 match between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield on October 30, 2019 in Liverpool, England.

As per a growing number of outlets in Turkey over the last 24 hours, Ozil is now all-but a Fenerbahce player. Journalist Berkay Tokgoz has gone as far as to claim that a deal is already complete, with the experienced midfielder having even picked out the no.23 jersey at the Ülker Stadium: Yılın bombası patlıyor.

If the host of aforementioned updates were not enough to point towards a deal being imminent, though, what certainly has is the latest social media activity on the part of none other than Ozil himself. In a post on his official Twitter account this evening, the 32-year-old revealed a photo of himself in Istanbul, the city in which Fenerbahce play, accompanied by the simple caption ‘this city…’ This city …  #throwback #Istanbul pic.twitter.com/6gani0scjL — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) January 5, 2021 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
