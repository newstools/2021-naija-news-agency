French youth international Guendouzi left north London ahead of the transfer deadline in October, making the move to Bundesliga outfit Hertha Berlin for the 2020/21 campaign. The 21-year-old’s exit of course came with Guendouzi having slipped majorly down the pecking order at the Emirates over the final months of last season. He was accused of taunting several Brighton stars over finances during a defeat at the Amex back in June, and had since failed to garner a single appearance. As such, with Mikel Arteta having made abundantly clear that he is not afraid to completely freeze out members of his Arsenal squad (just ask Mesut Ozil), Guendouzi’s eventual exit did not come as much of a surprise. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GettyImages-1195399077-1024x833.jpg" alt="2nd Arsenal chance in store?

The youngster has featured in the club’s last 9 league outings, playing all 90 minutes versus the likes of Augsburg, Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Levekusen.

This comes amid claims that Hertha are already lining up potential replacements for the gifted midfielder. As per a report from German outlet Bild, the Bundesliga outfit do not boast an option to make Guendouzi’s arrival permanent for a fixed sum in the summer. In turn, those in a position of power at the Olympiastadion have come to accept the fact that they will likely not be able to finance a swoop for the French talent. As a result, Hertha have turned their attentions elsewhere, with Wolfsburg star Yannick Gerhardt lined up as a replacement. Guendouzi therefore looks set to return to north London come the conclusion of the campaign, with the possibility of being reintegrated into Mikel Arteta’s first-team setup not out of the question.
