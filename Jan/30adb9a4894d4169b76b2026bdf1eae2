Dimitar Berbatov has suggested that it will currently be an “easy decision” for Tottenham to send Gareth Bale back to Real Madrid. Bale made his long-awaited return to Spurs this summer after spending the last seven years in Spain with Real Madrid. The Welshman rejoined Tottenham on loan for the rest of the season. But Bale has not featured much at all under Jose Mourinho so far. Top ten best decisions of the Premier League season The 31-year-old has only started once in the Premier League this term. He has only made one substitute appearance in Spurs’ previous ten league games. Bale started in all six of Tottenham’s Europa League group games, but he only scored once. He has three goals overall from his 12 appearances across all competitions. Berbatov told Stats Perform that Bale cannot be producing “the right level of football” at the moment: “I was expecting a lot of him coming to Spurs, to shake things up and for him, Son and Kane to make it a trio up front that can rival the Liverpool attacking trio, for example. “For the moment it is 100 per cent not working. Hopefully, he can get back to 100 per cent and start playing. If not, in the end, it is an easy decision – he can go back to Madrid. “Whatever the reason [for his lack of games] Gareth Bale is injury-free now is because he’s on the bench for the team. “But he’s not playing from the from the first minute so it means that obviously, he’s not producing the right level of football Jose Mourinho wants from him, which is a shame because I like him a lot.” The post Berbatov: Bale’s Tottenham return is ‘100% not working’ appeared first on Football News –.
