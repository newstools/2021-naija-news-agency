Man Utd loanee Odion Ighalo has admitted he would like to remain at Old Trafford past January 31st ‘if it’s possible’. The striker is currently on loan from Chinese side Shanghai Shenhua. He joined for a year in January 2020, with the deal set to expire at the end of this month. READ: Aston Villa v Everton off with ‘significant number’ in isolation Ighalo has now revealed his hopes of remaining in the Premier League with United. Speaking to ESPN, the player said: “Today, I’m in Manchester but at the end of the month I don’t know where I’m going to be. If it’s possible I’d like to stay here but if not I have to go.” Ighalo thinks a move to the MLS could be on the cards, if his time at United does come to an end. He continued: “I have options. I wait for my agent. He is doing his job and I’m doing mine. At the end of the month, we have to decide what is best and we’ll take it. If it’s possible I’d like to play in [the] MLS but I have to wait to see if it’s possible. “The league is doing well and if the opportunity arises then I’d grab it with two hands.” The Nigeria international has made four appearances for the Red Devils this season. His only Premier League appearance came in the opening day defeat to Roy Hodgson’s Crystal Palace. Ighalo is seen as a backup for first team strikers Edinson Cavani and Anthony Martial. The 31-year-old seems to be content with that situation due to his affinity for the club. Ighalo revealed when joining that he is a boyhood fan. Speaking to the club’s official website, he said: “I supported the team when I was young. People that know me, even back in Nigeria, and even when I was playing at Watford, my team-mates knew that I loved Man Utd. I support them.” The post Striker Ighalo hoping to extend loan spell with Man Utd appeared first on Football News –. Read the Original Article
