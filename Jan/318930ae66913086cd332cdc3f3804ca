When the name of Gunners midfielder Ozil is brought to the fore, controversy is usually not too far in following behind. This of course comes with the 32-year-old having endured a 2020 to forget at the Emirates, after being completely frozen out by Mikel Arteta. Bizarrely, despite first being heavily relied upon by the new Arsenal boss following his arrival late in 2018, since football’s return on the back of the initial Covid-19 outbreak last year, Ozil has not received a single minute of playing time. In fact, having been omitted from both the club’s Premier League and Europa League squads for the opening half of the campaign, the widespread assumption is that the former Real Madrid man has likely already played his last game in Arsenal’s colours. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg" alt="Ultimate Arsenal XI, thoughts on Smith Rowe and a major Fenerbahce transfer hint: The highlights from Mesut Ozil’s Q&amp;A"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 15: Per Mertesacker and Fredrik Ljungberg of Arsenal look on as Mesut Ozil kicks his gloves in the air in frustration after he is subbed during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Manchester City at Emirates Stadium on December 15, 2019 in London, United Kingdom. (Photo by Robin Jones/Getty Images) Ozil, in turn, has spent much of his time of late voicing his opinions on social media, with many of an Arsenal persuasion of course still in favour of the German being reintegrated into the club’s first-team setup. Ozil is searching his name and liking tweets  pic.twitter.com/hgCsbAPJ2U — Nikolas (@graduationstan) November 8, 2020 And, as outlined above, this evening, the out-of-favour Arsenal star’s Twitter activity has taken centre stage online. This comes with Ozil having held a public Q&A with his followers, under the hashtag #AskMesut. The veteran midfielder, to his credit, appeared to make use of the opportunity as more than simply a publicity stunt, and did provide a number of in-depth, insightful replies to fans. Some of the highlights, meanwhile, are showcased below, including Ozil’s top XI of players whom he has played alongside during his time in north London, opinion on Gunners youngster Emile Smith Rowe, and a less than subtle hint that he could soon be on his way to Turkish giants Fenerbahce: Easy question.

He is a great coach with numerous titles. Most of all, he’s a great, sincere person. I associate him with my greatest Arsenal successes. I will always remember that time with him positively. https://t.co/PsPAwwbUxP — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) January 11, 2021 He made the difference in the last couple of games as a No 10 – really happy for him… and that he showed that playing with a No 10 still can make sense in today’s football. @emilesmithrowe https://t.co/GDJeYTcSkz — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) January 11, 2021 Messi has proven himself to be one of the best ever in Spain, but Ronaldo was always the best in every country he’s played in!  https://t.co/OfsWqNLedM — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) January 11, 2021 I grew up as a @Fenerbahce fan as a kid in Germany – every German-Turkish person supports a Turkish team when they grow up in Germany.

There are two countries I want to play football in before I retire: Turkey  and USA .
