The actress has presented several stellar looks in the past, but on this occasion she was in rare form . In this case she was serving up a different silhouette from Nigerian designer Lisa Folawiyo Studio, one of our favourites from the designers latest collection for the instant impact it makes. Predictably artistic, featuring a single diamante fringe that shows up beautifully when the wearer is in motion, the high neck and mini hemline gave it a sleek, sophisticated edge while the contrasting colour palette in the stunning prints Lisa Folawiyo is known for, provide the brand’s signature dramatic finishing touches and has a very fresh, youthful feel. For accessories, she opted for simple earrings and silver strappy heels. A sleek ponytail and arresting eye makeup completed this irresistible look. We definitely think BellaStylistas will be inspired by looks like this one in 2021- appropriate for intimate gatherings as well as celebratory photo shoots ( and if they aren’t, they really should be!) <img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/131891873_859738227950914_7760543023127105073_n.jpg"/> @ekuedewor <img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/131922299_1355722708122524_4451391913281161594_n.jpg"/> @ekuedewor <img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/131999296_166682405144432_8221425720633301459_n.jpg"/> @ekuedewor <img src="https://www.bellanaijastyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/131582734_388889352419449_7432185243738211465_n.jpg"/> @ekuedewor Credits Makeup @merakibyonome Dress @lisafolawiyostudio Hair @taupe_salon Visuals @traycieespieces The post A Fresh Lisa Folawiyo Studio Look to Try Out This Year- Courtesy Eku Edewor appeared first on BellaNaija – Showcasing Africa to the world.
