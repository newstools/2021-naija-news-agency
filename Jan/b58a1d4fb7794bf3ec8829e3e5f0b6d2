The major talking point surrounding ongoings at the Emirates on Sunday has of course come in the form of Mesut Ozil’s imminent departure. German midfielder Ozil, having not lined out for Arsenal on a single occasion since last March, has evidently come to the conclusion over the last couple of weeks that his time in the colours of the Gunners is up. In turn, as confirmed on Saturday, the 32-year-old has agreed to a contract termination in north London, 6 months prior to his scheduled departure date: EXCLUSIVE: Arsenal & Mesut Ozil have an agreement in principle to terminate contract with immediate effect + end his 7.5yr #AFC career. If all goes to plan Fenerbahce expect 32yo to travel this weekend & complete move to #FENER as free agent @TheAthleticUK https://t.co/b9JCDK3miJ — David Ornstein (@David_Ornstein) January 16, 2021 This has since been swiftly followed, meanwhile, by Ozil all-but confirming his next destination, via a series of social media posts. The one-time Real Madrid standout is primed to link up with Turkish giants Fenerbahce, who beat out competition from MLS outfit DC United to convince him of their project: https://t.co/cpicr1zksP — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) January 16, 2021 pic.twitter.com/jPQ2hrCz7W — Mesut Özil (@MesutOzil1088) January 17, 2021 Whilst one problem in north London inches towards being solved, however, another (albeit considerably less serious) is now set to imminently come to the fore. This comes in the form of the decision regarding who takes over Arsenal’s no.10 jersey from Ozil. The number is of course highly respected at clubs across the globe, with the individual honoured with its use often considered the leader of his side’s attack. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/GettyImages-1194132287-1024x683.jpg" alt="Arsenal strikers take to social media to joke over who will inherit Mesut Ozil’s no.10 jersey"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 15: Per Mertesacker and Fredrik Ljungberg of Arsenal look on as Mesut Ozil kicks his gloves in the air in frustration after he is subbed during the Premier League match between Arsenal FC and Manchester City at Emirates Stadium on December 15, 2019 in London, United Kingdom.

In an Instagram post earlier today, Alexandre Lacazette revealed a photo of he and strike partner Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, accompanied by the caption: ‘When you both want the number 10.’ This evidently pointed towards both players being keen on replacing Ozil, giving rise to a potential problem for Mikel Arteta. Aubameyang, however, quickly responded to his close friend, hinting that he is in fact ready to step aside, allowing Laca to take on the honour of the 10 shirt: ‘They said they put it away. All yours my bro.’ In turn, the Frenchman tagged soon-to-be former teammate Ozil, before adding that ‘It (the number) will be in good care.’ Check out the exchange below: Aubameyang and Lacazette joking about who will get the no.10 shirt after Mesut Ozil leaves #AFC. pic.twitter.com/MEGthBLNjq — Chris Wheatley (@ChrisWheatley_) January 17, 2021 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
