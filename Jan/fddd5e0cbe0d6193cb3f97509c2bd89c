Mikel Arteta’s men are currently locked in action at the Hawthorns. The north Londoners of course headed into proceedings with their tails up, on the back of a much-needed upturn in form of late. Arsenal brought an end to a run of 7-straight Premier League outings without a win last weekend, en route to a 3-1 downing of capital rivals Chelsea. And the Gunners followed up with another 3-point haul during the week, when they got the better of Brighton & Hove Albion at the Amex. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1293643283-1024x679.jpg" alt="Brilliant Arsenal get fitting term trending on social media following first-half double vs West Brom"/> BRIGHTON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 29: Alexandre Lacazette of Arsenal celebrates with teammate Bukayo Saka after scoring his team’s first goal during the Premier League match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Arsenal at American Express Community Stadium on December 29, 2020 in Brighton, England.

The visitors currently lead by 2 goals to nil at the Hawthorns, courtesy of a splendid pair of first-half strikes. The first came just past the 20-minute mark, through a surprise source. After picking up the ball on the left wing, Kieran Tierney burst down the line, cut inside into the West Brom box, before unleashing a pinpoint right-footed effort into the far top corner of Sam Johnstone’s goal: Ohhh! Kieran Tierney! That is special! A terrific solo goal from the Arsenal man Struck with aplomb!  pic.twitter.com/gQ0r6NGs37 — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) January 2, 2021 And, 5 minutes later, Arsenal were at it again. Bukayo Saka was the man on target on this occasion, but, unlike Tierney’s effort, which came courtesy of a moment of individual brilliance, the Gunners’ 2nd of the evening rounded out a wonderful team move. On the back of an exchange between all of Emile Smith Rowe, Alexandre Lacazette and goalscorer Saka, the English international was eventually teed up for the simplest of finishes into an empty net: Vintage Arsenal! An excellent team move completed by Bukayo Saka That was superb!  pic.twitter.com/jQKtlQlJ4Z — Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) January 2, 2021 And Arsenal’s exploits, as outlined above, have since not gone at all unrecognised amongst the contingent reacting to the clash online. Incredibly, so good were the visitors’ opening pair of strikes versus West Brom, that they have since resulted in a 3-word exclamation trending across social media. The phrase ‘what a goal’ has racked up well over 25,000 Tweets this evening, with some of the highlights showcased below: What. A.
