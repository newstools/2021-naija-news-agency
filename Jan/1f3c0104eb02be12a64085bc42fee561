The Pensioners of course returned to action on Sunday, in the marquee fixture of the Premier League weekend. Chelsea welcomed Manchester City to Stamford Bridge, in search of a much needed bounce-back display. Lampard’s men had managed just a solitary win in their previous 6 across all competitions prior to the clash, a run which had seen the capital giants slip off the pace of not only the title race, but the top-4, too. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1293498502-1024x683.jpg" alt="Chelsea latest: As Tuchel waits in the wings, Lampard ‘not in immediate danger’"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 28: (l – r) Mason Mount, N’Golo Kante,Jorginho, Cesar Azpilicueta and Edouard Mendy of Chelsea appeal to to match referee, Stuart Attwell after Aston Villa’s first goal scored by Anwar El Ghazi (Not pictured) during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge on December 28, 2020 in London, England.

A frankly embarrassing first-half performance on the part of the hosts allowed an admittedly superb City to race out to a 3-goal advantage within the opening 35 minutes. After Ilkay Gundogan opened the game’s scoring, Phil Foden added a Citizens 2nd just minutes later, before Kevin De Bruyne’s neat finish all but killed off any remaining hope of a Chelsea comeback. 4 – Kevin De Bruyne has now scored four goals against Chelsea in the Premier League; the most a former player has netted against the Blues in the competition.

In fact, it was even claimed on Sunday night that the Chelsea board had already begun looking into potential replacements for their former midfield star: Chelsea hierarchy looking at alternatives to Lampard Concerns over struggles of Havertz and Werner Tensions between manager and some of squad After losing to #MCFC, Lampard’s position is in jeopardy…#CFC | #CHEMCI | @liam_twomey | @SJohnsonSport — The Athletic UK (@TheAthleticUK) January 3, 2021 As outlined above, however, if the latest word stemming from the English media 24 hours later is to be believed, then Lampard remains safe… for now at least. As per a report from the reliable Nizaar Kinsella of Goal, the Blues boss ‘has time on his side’ to turn things around. Lampard is said to remain a popular figure amongst Chelsea’s squad, a key factor in the club not yet taking any drastic action. Should results not improve over the weeks ahead, however, it is not out of the question that the inexperienced Englishman could eventually be relieved of his duties, with Thomas Tuchel tipped as one to keep an eye on when it comes to potential replacements. The German was recently let go by French champions PSG, and has made clear his desire to try his hand in the Premier League. Another option comes in the form of ex-Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri.
