The first comes in the form of the latest on a potential exit for Brandon Williams. 20-year-old stopper Williams of course exploded onto the scene at Old Trafford last season. Having long been considered one of the most promising youngsters on the books of United, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s youth drive saw the talented left-back handed the chance to impress as part of the club’s first-team squad. In turn, despite having, at times, struggled for consistency, Williams went on to rack up a none too shabby 37 appearances across all competitions. As such, it has since come as something of a surprise to see the English youth international struggle so badly for game-time over the early months of the new season. Amid fresh competition from summer arrival Alex Telles, and the form of the resurgent Luke Shaw, Williams has been afforded just a solitary Premier League appearance. Rumours linking the United youth product with a potential January departure from Old Trafford, in turn, have inevitably begun to mount of late. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177964270-1024x777.jpg" alt="Man United left-back latest: ‘Framework agreed’ for Williams’ Newcastle switch/Rojo tipped for Boca"/> BELGRADE, SERBIA – OCTOBER 24: Brandon Williams of Manchester United during the UEFA Europa League group L match between Partizan and Manchester United at Partizan Stadium on October 24, 2019 in Belgrade, Serbia.

The outfit in question? Newcastle United. As per a report from the Shields Gazette, an agreement in principle has been struck between the Magpies and United, over the terms of a 6-month loan deal. A transfer is not yet viewed as imminent, however, with ‘a host of other clubs’ also maintaining an interest in the starlet’s signature. Would he be a good addition, #NUFC fans? https://t.co/pDviIxeGWU — Shields Gazette (@shieldsgazette) January 5, 2021 Williams, though, may not be the only left-footed defender in line to depart Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad this month. The other? Marcos Rojo. Rojo, like Williams, has found minutes on the pitch tough to come by this season. This does not exactly mark a new experience for the Argentine, though, with Rojo, amid struggles for both form and fitness, having remained completely out of favour at Old Trafford for several years now. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1158653550-1024x683.jpg" alt="Man United left-back latest: ‘Framework agreed’ for Williams’ Newcastle switch/Rojo tipped for Boca"/> OSLO, NORWAY – JULY 30: Marcos Rojo of Manchester United arrives to the stadium ahead of the Pre-Season Friendly match between Kristiansund BK and Manchester United at Ullevaal Stadion on July 30, 2019 in Oslo, Norway.

According to Argentine journalist Martin Arevalo of TyC Sports, Rojo is primed for a move to Boca Juniors. ‘Everything’ is said to have been agreed between the parties, with the 30-year-old expected to put pen to paper on a 3-year deal at the Bombonera over the weeks ahead: Uno de estos 2 fenómenos tiene todo acordado para ser refuerzo de @bocajrsoficial.Son amigos, jugaron juntos varios años en @ManUtd. Y a los 2 le gustan los lujos… @paulpogba los hace seguidos. Marcos  tiró una rabona en el area del #Maracaná en el debut.
