Spurs midfielder Dele Alli is ‘pushing’ for a Paris Saint-Germain loan move this month, according to reports. The Englishman has been left out of the first team by manager Jose Mourinho for large parts of the season. He is yet to play a full 90 minutes this term, having been used as a substitute regularly. FEATURE: 16 Conclusions: Liverpool 0-0 Manchester United According to Sky Sports, Alli is ‘pushing’ for the transfer to PSG to go through. He reportedly wants to make a loan move during the January transfer window to get his career back on track. The report states that Alli respects everyone at the club, but he just wants to get regular first team football. The move would see him reunite with former boss Mauricio Pochettino, who took charge of the French club earlier this month. Pochettino managed Alli when he was at his best. The 24-year-old scored 18 goals and assisted nine more during the 2016/17 season. He is yet to achieve any form this season after playing poorly on multiple occasions. Alli’s troubles seemed to start when he was subbed off against LASK in the Europa League. Mourinho brought him off at half time, during a game which Spurs went on to lose 1-0. In December, Alli remained an unused sub during the game against Royal Antwerp. Speaking about Alli after the match, Mourinho said: “Let’s not run away from reality. A player on the bench who realises all five subs have been used of course is not a happy player and I would not expect him to be happy.” Mourinho now uses Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso to provide creativity in his midfield. Ndombele scored a stunning goal in their 3-1 victory over Sheff Utd yesterday. The midfield competition has worsened his situation at the club. It looks like Alli is nearing a switch to Ligue 1 as he prepares for the European Championships this summer.
