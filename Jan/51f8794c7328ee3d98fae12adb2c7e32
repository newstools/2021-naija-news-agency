Former Chelsea manager Avram Grant has denied claims he will make a surprise return to Stamford Bridge. On Tuesday, reports suggested he could return to help current boss Frank Lampard. It was thought that owner Roman Abramovich wanted him to add some experience to the coaching staff.

Speaking on social media (via talkSPORT), the 65-year-old said: “I read the links in the media connecting me with a return to Chelsea. “I have so many positive messages from Chelsea fans on Instagram. Thank you. “But I must say I didn’t receive any official approach from the club. I can repeat only what I said lately about the situation at Chelsea. “Be strong and look for [a] solution! What everybody needs now is time. “It’s good for Frank and I believe that he will do the job well and is good for the club. Good luck to everybody.” Grant is a personal friend of Abramovich. He was made Director of Football in July 2007 and became manager a few months later, taking over from Jose Mourinho. The Israeli boss took the Blues to the League Cup final in 2008, which they ultimately lost to Spurs. They also lost in the Champions League final against fellow Prem side Man Utd. Grant maintained an unbeaten home record in the Premier League during his season in charge and was named as the league’s Manager of the Month in April 2008. Current boss Lampard is under pressure following a few poor results recently. Chelsea lost against Wolves and London rivals Arsenal in December. They also lost 3-1 to Man City towards the start of January. Lampard will be hoping his team can find some form, starting with a victory in their next Premier League match. The Blues face Fulham tomorrow at 17:30. The post Former Chelsea boss Avram Grant denies claims he could return appeared first on Football News –. Read the Original Article
