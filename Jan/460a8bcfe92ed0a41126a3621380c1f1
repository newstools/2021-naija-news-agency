The Gunners and Magpies are set to get their respective FA Cup campaigns underway tomorrow evening. Arsenal will welcome Steve Bruce’s men to north London, for one of three all-Premier League 3rd-round ties (the others both take place tonight, in the form of Aston Villa vs Liverpool, and Wolves vs Crystal Palace). The hosts head into Saturday’s action as clear favourites to book their spot in the competition’s 4th-round, amid a long overdue upturn in form of late. On the back of 7-straight outings without a Premier League win, Mikel Arteta’s Gunners have since rattled off a trio of consecutive victories over the last couple of weeks. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-1294180007-1024x650.jpg" alt="The latest on Newcastle pair Saint-Maximin &amp; Lascelles ahead of Arsenal clash"/> WEST BROMWICH, ENGLAND – JANUARY 02: Kieran Tierney of Arsenal celebrates with teammates Rob Holding, Dani Ceballos and Pablo Mari after scoring their team’s first goal during the Premier League match between West Bromwich Albion and Arsenal at The Hawthorns on January 02, 2021 in West Bromwich, England.

As such, for obvious reasons, Steve Bruce will no doubt be desperate to have as strong a squad as possible at his disposal, when the Magpies make the trip to the capital tomorrow evening. Speaking in his pre-match press conference this evening, however, the Newcastle boss confirmed that his side will be without a trio of players, in the form of sidelined duo Jamal Lewis and Ryan Fraser, and Allan Saint-Maximin, who has only just recovered from a bout of Covid-19. There was more positive news, though, regarding captain Jamaal Lascelles: ‘Jamal Lewis has a knock to his knee so he’ll not make it. Ryan Fraser is edging closer but he’ll not make the weekend. Jamaal Lascelles has been given the go ahead. Saint-Maximin is back in the country and we’re waiting for the go ahead for him to train.’ Bruce also went on to confirm that Martin Dubravka is set to be handed a chance to impress between the posts versus Arsenal, having fallen behind the in-form Karl Darlow in the goalkeeping pecking order at St. James’ Park: ‘Martin will play. It’s the ideal one for him. How fortunate we are in that area. We all understand what he has done in his Newcastle career and now Karl has grasped that opportunity too. The competition is good so we welcome back Martin.’ Steve Bruce speaks to the press ahead to tomorrow’s #FACup tie against Arsenal…#ARSNEW pic.twitter.com/CNErMs4OxY — Newcastle United FC (@NUFC) January 8, 2021 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
