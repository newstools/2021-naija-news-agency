Bites the Dust- Simi & Adekunle Gold Not every time ‘God when’ at least, that's the message they send on Bite the Dust where the music power couple sing the part of estranged lovers after betraying the other's trust. However, at the end, Simi couldn't resist throwing her script out the window when her hubby signed out singing ‘AG baby is not your baby,’ to which she laughed cynically before cussing him out. <iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d4sdAFttoy0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0"></iframe> 3.
