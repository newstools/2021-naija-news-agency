He said: “Although Mikano has always been known as a service provider in many aspects, including Power, Steel, Foods and Medical, our decision to invest in the automotive sector was motivated by our belief that Nigeria deserves a better transportation experience, rather than being a dumping area for second-hand cars with no history, no warranty, and no spare parts. Therefore, we chose to assemble and ultimately manufacture a top-quality automotive brand to create jobs for the youths, help stimulate the nation’s economy, and further support Nigerian families with the most comfortable and affordable mean s of transportation.” Aside from being a Chinese automotive brand that recorded top scores in the European Car Assessment Programme (EuroNCAP), Geely vehicles, via its acquisition of top European brands, including Volvo and Lotus, are produced in line with European standards.

To ensure that it is auto buying customers run their cars with peace of mind, the company has covered the entire landscape of Nigeria with various after-sales service centers. “Already,” he explained, “we have 3s (Showroom, service center, and Spare parts) and 2s (Showroom and Service Centre) locations all over Nigeria. The centers are equipped with modem tools to ensure effective after-salesservices to our customers.” Through our appointed dealership across the country, Geely automobile brand’s spare parts are now available nationwide. While we are still appointing more dealers to ensure that our parts are available to every location in Nige ria, we are making servicing parts available via various accredit ed channels to avoid the incident of fake parts.” Locally Assembled Emgrand 7 (Sedan) Powered by 1.5-liter engine, the locally assembled Geely Emgrand 7 now on sale in Nigeria, comes with a load of safety features, some of which are seatbelt reminder, over speeding alarm device, an anti-theft alarm device, hand brake unreleased reminder, (anti-lock brake system + electronic brakeforce distribution (EBO), reversing visual system, door child safety lock, collision safety fuel cut system, speed-sensitive automatic door locking system, explosion-proof leak proof visual system, door child safety lock, collision safety fuel cut system, speed-sensitive automatic door locking system, explosion-proof leak-proof plastic fuel tank, etc more than that, the car is equipped with cruise control, remote central locking, keyless entry-driver side, head restraints, air conditioning system and infotainment.
