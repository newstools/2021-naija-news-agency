The Blues are set to welcome Pep Guardiola’s men to Stamford Bridge on Sunday, for the marquee fixture of the Premier League weekend. Chelsea will of course head into proceedings in search of a bounce-back result, on the back of a concerning spell of form of late. After looking as though they had finally found their stride following a disappointing opening to the campaign, the capital giants have since majorly struggled over the last couple of weeks. The Pensioners have notched just a single win from their last 6 across all competitions, the latest of which saw Lampard and co. held to a 1-1 stalemate by Aston Villa. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1293498502-1024x683.jpg" alt="The latest on Chelsea pair James &amp; Ziyech ahead of Man City/Lampard confirms Covid cases at club"/> LONDON, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 28: (l – r) Mason Mount, N’Golo Kante,Jorginho, Cesar Azpilicueta and Edouard Mendy of Chelsea appeal to to match referee, Stuart Attwell after Aston Villa’s first goal scored by Anwar El Ghazi (Not pictured) during the Premier League match between Chelsea and Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge on December 28, 2020 in London, England.

As such, it goes without saying that Frank Lampard will be desperate to see his side get back to winning ways in 48 hours’ time, with a statement downing of Man City. As confirmed by the Blues boss on Friday, however, his side’s efforts to do just that will come without the services of a key defender. Speaking in a press conference this afternoon, Lampard was drawn on the current fitness levels of his squad. And the English tactician’s first update surrounded Reece James, who is set to sit out versus City, having failed to recover from a hamstring problem: ‘Reece James is out, he’s got a small hamstring problem.’ <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1272484904-1024x730.jpg" alt="The latest on Chelsea pair James &amp; Ziyech ahead of Man City/Lampard confirms Covid cases at club"/> BRIGHTON, ENGLAND – SEPTEMBER 14: Reece James of Chelsea scores his sides second goal during the Premier League match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Chelsea at American Express Community Stadium on September 14, 2020 in Brighton, England.

Moroccan creator Ziyech has not featured in any of Chelsea’s last 6 outings, since picking up a hamstring injury of his own versus Leeds earlier this month. Lampard confirmed, however, that the summer addition to his squad has taken part in training over the last couple of days, and therefore looks set for a return to the club’s matchday squad on Sunday: ‘He’s fit to train and has trained the last two or three days so I’ll have to make the decision on whether he’s ready to start.’ The final noteworthy takeaway from Lampard’s press conference surrounded the Covid-19 situation at Stamford Bridge, with the Chelsea boss having confirmed that, though, unlike City, his playing squad have not been hit by the virus, a number of the club’s backroom staff have returned positive tests: ‘We know that Manchester City had some positives within their training ground. We have had a couple ourselves but not on the playing staff and that’s the current situation.’ #ICYMI Team news updates for City as Lampard confirms defender set to miss out — Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) January 1, 2021 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
