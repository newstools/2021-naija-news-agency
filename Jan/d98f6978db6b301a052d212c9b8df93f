Austrian stopper Alaba has of course long stood as a key cog in the success of Bundesliga champions Bayern. The 28-year-old has spent his entire senior career to date on the books of the Bavarians, since making the move to Munich from his home country in 2009. Alaba possesses a whole host of talents, boasting pace to burn, athleticism, an eye for a pass, superb crossing technique and a hammer of a left foot. In turn, for some time, the 75-time capped international was widely considered to be the best left-back in world football. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GettyImages-655222214-1024x665.jpg" alt="Andreas Christensen"/> MOENCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY – MARCH 19: David Alaba of Bayern Munich is challenged by Andreas Christensen of Borussia Moenchengladbach during the Bundesliga match between Borussia Moenchengladbach and Bayern Muenchen at Borussia-Park on March 19, 2017 in Moenchengladbach, Germany.

The Austrian, whilst a full-back by trade, is more than capable of lining out in the middle of the park, and, since the emergence of Alphonso Davies at the Allianz Arena, has actually spent the majority of his time at centre-half. All told, Alaba has racked up well over 350 appearances for Bayern, securing 23 trophies along the way, including 9 Bundesliga titles and a pair of Champions League crowns. As such, it has long come as a source of concern for all associated with the German champions to see Alaba’s deal in Munich continue to wind down. As things stand, the versatile stopper is due to be become a free agent this summer, having failed to come to an agreement on the terms of a fresh contract. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/GettyImages-1055539040-1024x683.jpg" alt="PL giants to miss out amid claims Real Madrid on verge of David Alaba deal"/> ROEDINGHAUSEN, GERMANY – OCTOBER 30: Players, David Alaba, Meritan Shabani, Thomas Mueller, Sandro Wagner, Javi Martinez and Niklas Suele of Bayern Muenchen clebrtae vicotry after the DFB Cup match between SV Rodinghausen and FC Bayern Munich at Hacker-Wiehenstadion on October 30, 2018 in Roedinghausen, Germany.

And, as outlined above, if the latest word stemming from Spain is to be believed, then one outfit appear to have positioned themselves firmly in the driver’s seat to clinch a deal. Despite links with the likes of Chelsea, Liverpool and Juventus, it is claimed that Real Madrid are very much closing on Alaba’s services. As per a report from Marca, the Austrian is keen to announce his next club over the coming days. Los Blancos, in turn, are primed to swoop, with Alaba having long favoured a move to the Bernabeu over all other destinations. In turn, a deal between the parties could be announced as early as next week, though the stopper will not actually link up with Zinedine Zidane’s squad until the summer, upon the expiration of his contract in Munich. In the next few days, David Alaba wants to announce the name of the team in which he will play next season. Real Madrid is planning to make a move in the coming days. Alaba is interested and the final move could take place next week [@jfelixdiaz, @marca] pic.twitter.com/rq4wWNIVl8 — Bayern & Germany (@iMiaSanMia) January 1, 2021 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
