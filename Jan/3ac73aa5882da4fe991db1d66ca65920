A flat London derby between Arsenal and Crystal Palace finishes goalless at the Emirates. Having won their last three league outings to end a barren spell, the Gunners were unable to find a way past their visitors â€“ who came closest to winning the game through a James Tomkins header which hit the crossbar. The 0-0 draw means Palace remain unbeaten in their previous five meetings with Arsenal and they stay just a point behind Mikel Artetaâ€™s men. One point each. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f534.png" alt="ðŸ”´"/> 0-0 <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f985.png" alt="ðŸ¦…"/> (FT)#ARSCRY â€” Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 14, 2021 Arsenal made two changes to the side that won 4-0 at West Brom in their last league outing â€“ both enforced as Kieran Tierney and Pablo Mari were left out as precautions. The hosts were largely frustrated by a Palace side playing on the counter-attack and on the few occasions they did get in behind, they largely wasted the opportunity. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang shot straight at Vicente Guaita in one moment of promise, while Hector Bellerin managed to take the ball off the foot of team-mate Alexandre Lacazette when the in-form France forward looked poised to strike. It would be Palace who came closest to breaking the deadlock before the interval â€“ firstly as Eberechi Ezeâ€™s deep free-kick was headed against the frame of the goal by Tomkins. Then Bernd Leno was called into action, making a fine diving stop to keep out Christian Bentekeâ€™s effort moments later. Arsenal were still struggling to unlock a rigid Palace backline after the restart and were restricted to pot-shots on Guiaitaâ€™s goal on the few occasions their attacks did not break down. Arteta responded by introducing club-record signing Nicolas Pepe in place of Ainsley Maitland-Niles, with Bukayo Saka reverting to left-back as a result. Palace were still a threat on the break and Zaha burst forward only to see his cross towards Eze cleared away by a backtracking Granit Xhaka. Benteke miscued his header from the resulting corner and James McArthur turned the ball into the grateful grasp of Leno. Zaha wanted a penalty after going down under pressure from Rob Holding but referee Andre Marriner correctly waved away the protests. Arsenal suddenly moved up a gear as the game entered the closing stages but never looked like getting the goal to settle the contest and remain 11th in the table as a result.
