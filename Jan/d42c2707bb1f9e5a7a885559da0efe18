<img src="https://notjustok.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Don-Jazzy.jpg" alt="Stingy men association"/> Nigerians are famously known for their flamboyance and showiness at parties and everywhere else. This same attribute has been carried on in our songs, where musicians often sing about their wealth and go as far as urging their love interests to indulge in their wealth. That narrative now seems to be taking a twist due to the recent formation of the Stingy Men Association of Nigeria with highbrow members from the entertainment world such as Don Jazzy and Mr Eazi amongst them. Formed as an elaborate joke on social media app, Twitter, it is said to have been created to overcome excessive billing by members of the opposite gender.

This is definitely the soundtrack for members of the SMAN who are dedicated to keeping their wealth for themselves. <iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pKQOJ862ONQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0"></iframe> This is a touching song that shows the anguish felt by a man whose lover wants financial loving and not only the emotional currency he can currently afford. While men of the SMAN may be able to afford more, the plea in this song is definitely up their alley. <iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KQ7FpYDQLOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0"></iframe> The motto of the Stingy Men Association is ‘Let me see what I can do,’ a response to future monetary requests they intend to do nothing about. Ironically, on Identity by Oliver De Coque, he sings “I no dey promise anything wey my power no reach. My yes is my yes, my no is my no I no dey make inyanga, I'm a simple man by nature” and that sounds like lines from an OG that are worthy of emulating especially by members of the SMAN. Perhaps the association is in for a change of slogan after this. <iframe width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_gG1A_7M6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0"></iframe> This song makes the perfect addition to this playlist as Victor Olaiya not only captures how everyone struggles with money but the cards a woman might play on a man she’s involved with when in need of money. This calm highlife number definitely has all it takes to be the closing song for the meetings of members of the Stingymen Association of Nigeria. <iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Vv0BOGDH5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0"></iframe> Which of these songs do you think best fits the constitution of the Stingy Men Association of Nigeria?
