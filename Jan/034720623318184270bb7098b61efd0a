Khedira, 33, has endured a difficult campaign, to say the least. On the back of the arrivals of the likes of Arthur and Weston McKennie at the Allianz Stadium over the summer, new Juve boss Andrea Pirlo quickly made clear that Khedira was not part of his plans. In turn, the Italian opted to completely omit the former Real Madrid man from his 2020/21 Serie A squad. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1207296587-1024x683.jpg" alt="Sami Khedira reportedly in England to discuss Everton switch/Spurs also linked"/> TURIN, ITALY – FEBRUARY 19: Juventus player Sami Khedira runs during a training session at JTC on February 19, 2020 in Turin, Italy.

As per a report from Christian Falk of SportBild in the midfielder’s home country of Germany, Khedira has made his way to England, ahead of opening negotiations with Everton. Such claims come just weeks after Toffees boss Carlo Ancelotti hinted that he would be interested in bringing his former charge to Goodison Park during the winter window: ‘Sami Khedira was my player at Real Madrid, an important player for us.’ ‘I’ve a good memory of him, but I don’t think we are looking for him at this moment… Maybe in January.’ Interestingly, Falk also suggests that Khedira is keen to hold talks with other Premier League clubs, too, amid further rumoured interest in his services on the part of Tottenham: True  @SamiKhedira is in England for transfer talks with @Everton But Khedira wants to talk also with other clubs about a Transfer this Winter @SpursOfficial pic.twitter.com/5wEGSoc9b3 — Christian Falk (@cfbayern) December 31, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
