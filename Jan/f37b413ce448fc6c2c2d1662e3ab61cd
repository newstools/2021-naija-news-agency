Manchester United are in a “false position” at the top of the Premier League and will “drop off” as the season continues, according to Jason McAteer. United moved three points clear of Liverpool after their 1-0 win over Burnley on Tuesday, ahead of the showdown against Jurgen Klopp’s side this weekend. Manchester United: top of the league, top of winners and losers But former Liverpool midfielder McAteer claims United are fortunate to be where they are as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has not had the same problems as other managers. “As far as Manchester United sitting top of the table, I do think it’s a false position,” McAteer told Sky Sports News. “Burnley gave them a tough game but they came through it and showed a bit of resilience. There is a bit of team spirit coming at Manchester United. “But Ole hasn’t dealt with what other teams have dealt with, in terms of a lot of injuries this season. He’s had a lot of players to pick from.” United are unbeaten in 15 Premier League away games after their win at Turf Moor, with their last defeat on the road coming against Liverpool at Anfield in January, 2020. Liverpool, meanwhile, are unbeaten at home in the Premier League since April, 2017. And McAteer has backed his former club to extend that run on Sunday. “Come the end of the season, I think Liverpool and Manchester City will be fighting it out. I think Manchester United will drop off,” added McAteer. “When you look at their results, when they have played the likes of RB Leipzig, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester City and Arsenal, they haven’t come through those games. “It just tells me, when the big occasion comes, can Manchester United actually do it?” The post Man Utd in a ‘false position’; Ole has had it easy – McAteer appeared first on Football News –.
