The Red Devils welcomed Nuno Espirito Santo’s men to Old Trafford on Tuesday night, for their latest Premier League outing. United headed into proceedings with their tails up, on the back of a run of 5 unbeaten across all competitions. In turn, ahead of kick-off, Solskjaer and co. were no doubt aware that a win would guide them to within 2 points of table-topping Liverpool. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1230233512.jpg" alt="Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Alex Telles fitness and decision to replace Brazilian with Luke Shaw vs Wolves"/> MANCHESTER, ENGLAND – DECEMBER 20: Victor Lindelof of Manchester United celebrates after scoring a goal to make it 4-0 during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Leeds United at Old Trafford on December 20, 2020 in Manchester, United Kingdom.

An altogether forgetful 90 minutes eventually saw a solitary Marcus Rashford strike deep into injury-time separate the sides following the full-time whistle: RASHFORD IN INJURY TIME!@ManUtd have surely won it with a late strike from their superstar #PLonPrime #MUNWOL pic.twitter.com/ow3US3QCLh — Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) December 29, 2020 Whilst, in the end, Tuesday’s action played out in altogether positive fashion for United, one player who was nevertheless likely left disappointed by how proceedings unfolded was Alex Telles. Brazilian stopper Telles was handed a start by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, but was somewhat surprisingly removed from the fray at the interval. The United boss opted to replace his summer addition with Luke Shaw, who, to his credit, performed superbly over the course of the 2nd-half at Old Trafford. Nevertheless, speaking during a press conference this afternoon ahead of United’s meeting with Aston Villa, Solskjaer was drawn on his decision, and whether fitness had played a part. The Norwegian, though, went on to assure that Telles was substituted for purely ‘tactical’ reasons, and is available to feature in 24 hours’ time: Alex is fine. That was just a tactical decision we made, a change to the set-up. When pressed further on the state of his squad ahead of the Reds’ showdown with high-flying Villa, Solskjaer continued: We have a strong squad. We’ve rotated a lot and not really found, you’d say, a settled XI this season but I don’t think it’s about that anyway. It’s going to be about a squad of 25-26 players and I think, towards the end of the season, that will help us. It has to be done this way. When you leave out Scott and Fred, it’s not easy because they deserve to play every game. But Nemanja and Paul played so well against Everton that I wanted that midfield against Wolves. We’ll be getting injuries and suspensions, that will happen, but our squad is well capable and ready for every game. The boss faces some key decisions as our busy fixture schedule continues tomorrow… #MUFC #MUNAVL — Manchester United (@ManUtd) December 31, 2020 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
