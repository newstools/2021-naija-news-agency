23-year-old Fosu-Mensah has been on the books at Old Trafford since 2014. The versatile defender made the move to Manchester from Dutch giants Ajax, and quickly went on to establish himself as one of the most highly-regarded talents in United’s youth ranks. This eventually resulted in Fosu-Mensah being handed his senior Red Devils debut by fellow countryman Louis Van Gaal in 2016. And, all told, despite his tender years, the no-nonsense stopper went on to notch 8 Premier League appearances over the course of the 2015-16 campaign, including a pair of starts. As such, fans of Manchester United could have been forgiven for speculating that their side had unearthed a real star in the making, possessing all of the talents required to play a key role in the club’s colours for years to come. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/GettyImages-524458998-1024x682.jpg" alt="Timothy Fosu-Mensah"/> Timothy Fosu-Mensah during the Emirates FA Cup Semi Final between Everton and Manchester United at Wembley Stadium on April 23, 2016 in London, England. The seasons since, however, have seen this prove far from the case. Fosu-Mensah, amid a series of fitness problems and loan spells, has gone on to feature on only 8 further occasions for United in the Premier League, including just a solitary appearance to this point in the current campaign. As such, when the Dutchman last week opted to turn down the chance to extend his stay at Old Trafford (his contract is due to expire in the summer), a departure from the club this month, all of a sudden, emerged as a genuine possibility: He wasn’t happy with Man United’s offer #MUFChttps://t.co/Yy1Uv4tgMh — talkSPORT (@talkSPORT) January 5, 2021 And, as outlined above, such an exit now appears all but certain for Fosu-Mensah. As per a growing number of reports on Monday evening, Manchester United have agreed on the terms of a deal to sell their out-of-favour stopper to Bundesliga outfit Bayer Leverkusen. Ajax were also said to have expressed an interest in bringing Fosu-Mensah back to the Netherlands, but, in the end, it was Leverkusen who pushed hardest to secure an agreement. The transfer, which is expected to be announced imminently, will reportedly see United net just £1.5 million. The agreement has been reached between Manchester United and Bayer Leverkusen for Timothy Fosu-Mensah. Ajax were also interested but he’s joining Bayer. Done deal and here-we-go soon.  #mufc #bayer #transfers https://t.co/ZbNuMuCada — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 11, 2021 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
