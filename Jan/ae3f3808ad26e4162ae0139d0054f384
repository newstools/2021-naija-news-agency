Rio Ferdinand is not expecting Manchester United to make any more January signings after they completed the purchase of Amad Diallo. Diallo moved to Atalanta in 2015 after the club fended off interest from several Serie A sides. The winger spent four years in their youth team before he made his senior debut last season. The 18-year-old has made four senior appearances for Atalanta and he is one of the most highly-rated youngsters currently playing in Europe. Big Midweek: City v Villa, Lampard, Liverpool, Rashford Man United agreed to sign Diallo in October, but issues with his work permit held up the deal. But he officially joined the Red Devils on January 7 for an initial £18.7m. This deal includes around £20m more in add-ons. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side have been linked with a number of players. But they are expected to hold off on any more major signings until this summer. Ferdinand told the Stretford Paddock that he would be “very surprised” if United sign anyone else this month: “I don’t think he’ll bring anyone in. He is hoping that Diallo from Atalanta will come in and set the world alight in training – so he gives him some food for thought. “Listen, it is alright saying we want someone but who is selling in this market right now? I don’t see many teams who are willing to sell players right now. Unless you’re going to break the bank and pay monstrous fees. I don’t think Man United want to be doing that right now. “I think Man United will leave this window alone. I’d be very surprised if they go in again.” The post Ferdinand expects a quiet January window for Man Utd appeared first on Football News –. Read the Original Article
