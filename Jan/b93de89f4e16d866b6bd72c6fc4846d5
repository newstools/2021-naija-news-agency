The name of experienced hitman Cavani has of course taken centre stage in the media over recent weeks. This comes on the back of a lengthy disciplinary process, which eventually resulted in the Uruguayan being slapped with a suspension. Late in November, Cavani proved central in a Manchester United comeback victory over Southampton. In the aftermath of the clash, the former PSG standout was congratulated by a friend on Instagram, with Cavani’s reply to the message having been deemed as racially insensitive. In turn, the summer arrival at Old Trafford was charged with misconduct, and given until January 4th to launch a defence of his actions. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/GettyImages-1288438573-1024x683.jpg" alt="Man United questioned over lack of media training for banned Edinson Cavani"/> SOUTHAMPTON, ENGLAND – NOVEMBER 29: Edinson Cavani of Manchester United celebrates after he heads in and scores a goal to make it 3-2 during the Premier League match between Southampton and Manchester United at St Mary’s Stadium on November 29, 2020 in Southampton, England. Sporting stadiums around the UK remain under strict restrictions due to the Coronavirus Pandemic as Government social distancing laws prohibit fans inside venues resulting in games being played behind closed doors. (Photo by Robin Jones/Getty Images) Cavani, though, eventually opted against doing so. Official confirmation was therefore forthcoming last week that the South American had been hit with a 3-match ban, a £100,000 fine, and forced to attend a face-to-face education course: Edinson Cavani has been suspended for three games, fined £100,000 and must complete face-to-face education after admitting a charge for a breach of FA Rule E3 in relation to a social media post on Sunday 29 November 2020. A comment posted on the Manchester United FC striker’s Instagram page was insulting, abusive, improper and brought the game into disrepute contrary to FA Rule E3.1. The post also constitutes an “aggravated breach”, which is defined in FA Rule E3.2, as it included reference, whether express or implied, to colour and/or race and/or ethnic origin. Edinson Cavani has been suspended for three games, fined £100,000 and must complete face-to-face education after admitting a charge for a breach of FA Rule E3 in relation to a social media post on Sunday 29 November 2020.

As outlined above, though, one source which it has since been suggested should shoulder at least some of the blame for Cavani’s woes is none other than his club, Manchester United. Taking to social media on Thursday, the FA’s independent regulatory commission revealed the precise reasoning behind their eventual decision to sanction the 33-year-old. And, amid a lengthy statement, which can be viewed in full via the link below, the topic of media training, regarding what would generally be viewed as acceptable language, and not, was raised. The commission revealed their ‘surprise’ at the lack of training afforded to Cavani, seemingly pinning some of the blame for the situation on Manchester United in the process: ‘In light of the player’s high profile in the game, his inability to speak English and the fact that he had approaching eight million Instagram followers, the Commission were surprised that no such ‘training’ had been specifically put in place for the player by his club.’ The independent regulatory commission’s written reasons for Edinson Cavani’s sanction have now been published and can be found here: https://t.co/7GjXZKlOuw. — FA Spokesperson (@FAspokesperson) January 7, 2021 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
