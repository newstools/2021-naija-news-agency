The final fixture of the Premier League gameweek is currently being played out at St. Mary’s. Southampton welcomed the champions to the southeast, for a highly-anticipated matchup. Both sides headed into proceedings in search of a bounce-back result, on the back of a shaky couple of weeks. Hasenhuttl’s Saints were winless in their last four, a stretch which saw this evening’s hosts slip to mid-table in the English top-flight. Liverpool, meanwhile, were held to respective draws by West Brom and Newcastle over the last couple of weeks, allowing Manchester United to draw level with the Reds at the Premier League summit. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/GettyImages-1230319888.jpg" alt="Ralph Hasenhuttl provides explanation for respective absences of Che Adams &amp; Oriol Romeu vs Liverpool"/> West Bromwich Albion’s Nigerian defender Semi Ajayi (3rd R) climbs to head home their first goal during the English Premier League football match between Liverpool and West Bromwich Albion at Anfield in Liverpool, north west England on December 27, 2020.

Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl, in turn, was likely desperate to have as strong a squad as possible at his disposal, with the champions of course capable of lighting up any side in Europe when firing on all cylinders. It therefore came as a major blow when, upon the hosts’ matchday squad being made official a short time ago, a pair of key performers were nowhere to be seen. The players in question? Che Adams and Oriol Romeu.

And the Southampton boss went on to explain: ‘Che (Adams) got a horrible kick in the head and has concussion and is still struggling with it. Oriol (Romeu) really wanted to play today but yesterday had problems with his calf.’ The boss explains the absence of @CheAdams_ and @OriolRomeu tonight: pic.twitter.com/jH3qkCbTE2 — Southampton FC (@SouthamptonFC) January 4, 2021 Original Article Get all the Latest news, Breaking headlines,Sport, Education, Finance, Gists, Jobs, Music/Video, Technology and Top stories in real time in Nigeria and around the world.
