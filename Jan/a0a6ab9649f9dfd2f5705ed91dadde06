Kone has been on Toulouse’s books since joining their youth ranks in 2016. The now 19-year-old made his senior debut at the end of 2018/19, managing 69 minutes of action vs Dijon. The Frenchman was then handed a more prominent role in the following campaign, notching 13 Ligue 1 appearances. Toulouse would, of course, get relegated in 2019/20, and are now plying their trade in Ligue 2. Whilst that isn’t great for the club, it does look to have benefited Kone somewhat, as he is now a regular starter – a position he would unlikely be in this term had Toulouse still been fighting for survival in the French top-flight. So far this season, Kone has featured 17 times in Ligue 2, scoring one goal in the process. Kone’s solid displays have also seen him earn call-ups for both France’s under-19s and under-18s. Now, as mentioned above, the youngster appears to be attracting interest from England. According to Goal, citing French outlet FootMercato, Manchester United have joined the ‘hunt’ for Kone, with both AC Milan and Borussia Monchengladbach also credited with an interest in Kone, whose current contract runs until just 2022. Recent times have seen Man United set their sights on emerging young talent. The delayed summer window of course saw the Red Devils secure the services of Facundo Pellistri and Amad Diallo, both of whom are under 20 years of age. The Red Devils have also been linked quite heavily with 19-year-old Moises Caicedo of late. And Kone, of course, fits this bill. And with his contract not having too much time left to run, perhaps the Manchester powerhouse could snap him up for a fairly low fee.
