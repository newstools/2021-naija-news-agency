Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo says he will ‘analyse’ the defeat to West Brom and is hoping for a ‘reaction’ from his players. His team lost 3-2 in the Black Country derby at the Molineux Stadium. They went behind early in the game as Matheus Pereira scored a penalty. FEATURE: English quartet among 10 youngest players in Europe’s big leagues Fabio Silva equalised in the 38th-minute, scoring his first home goal in the process. Willy Boly then gave Wolves the lead just before half time. They couldn’t hold on however, as Semi Ajayi made it 2-2. Pereira scored a second penalty in the 56th-minute as the Baggies took home all three points. The defeat leaves Wolves ten points above the relegation zone and ten points off the top five. Speaking to BBC Sport after the match, Nuno said: “We didn’t do a good game or achieve a good result. It means a lot for us and our fans. We didn’t do what we should do defensively. “The start of the second half was very bad. Conceding goals makes our task very hard. We wanted to control the game and be aggressive in defence and we didn’t do it. “We knew that West Brom were trying from throw-ins, long balls and set pieces and we didn’t defend well. Coady came off – options, options. It was a simple decision. “We had chances and require better finishing. It’s very hard against a team that defends so well with men behind the ball. “We are all disappointed. We are aware it’s not a good moment for us, we have to react to it and work hard. “We think that a back four is better for us with the players we have, it is time to analyse and see what the next step forwards is.” Nuno will be hoping for a better performance in their next league match.
