Pep Guardiola’s men are set to return to Premier League action shortly, in a meeting with the Eagles at the Etihad. The Sky Blues will no doubt head into proceedings with their tails up, on the back of a 7-game win streak across all competitions, the latest of which saw City down Brighton by a goal to nil during the week. The Manchester giants will also be boosted by the result of the weekend’s marquee Premier League fixture, which saw Liverpool and Man United play out a 0-0 draw at Anfield earlier this evening. Manchester United remain top of the Premier League after a 0-0 draw with Liverpool at Anfield — Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) January 17, 2021 Should City secure 6 points from their two fixtures in hand, starting tonight, in turn, they will climb from their current 5th-place spot to the English top-flight’s summit. Ahead of their meeting with Palace, meanwhile, as is customary, the Citizens announced their starting line-up an hour prior to kick-off. Pep Guardiola’s decision to rotate his XI, with the likes of Joao Cancelo and Phil Foden dropping out, of course, quickly peaked attentions online. What proved even more of a talking point, however, were the pair of images which accompanied City’s line-up graphic. The club’s Twitter administrator opted to make use of ‘meme culture’, by photoshopping a trio of the Sky Blues’ stars in humourous fashion, whilst making sure to highlight how ‘the lads’ line up: How line-up tonight!
