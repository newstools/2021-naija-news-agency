Widespread speculation has of course surrounded the future of youngster Diallo over the last week. The 18-year-old was at the heart of one of a number of deadline day deals struck by United this past October. The gifted attacker joined Edinson Cavani, Alex Telles and Facundo Pellistri in putting pen to paper on terms with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men. Diallo, though, unlike the aforementioned trio, did not actually make the move to Manchester at the time. With the Reds having been waiting for international clearance and the processing of a new passport for their latest big-money addition, it was decided that he would remain in Italy for the opening half of the campaign. <img src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/GettyImages-1157006514-1024x683.jpg" alt="Insight provided into Amad Diallo’s defiant message to Atalanta following Solskjaer phone call"/> BERGAMO, ITALY – JULY 21: (L-R) Francesco Galuppini of AC Renate, Diallo Amad Traore of Atalanta Bergamo during the Club Friendly match between Atalanta Bergamo v Ac Renate at the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d Italia on July 21, 2019 in Bergamo Italy (Photo by Mattia Ozbot/Soccrates/Getty Images) As such, the United faithful were no doubt left concerned when, just hours after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer hinted that Diallo’s addition to his squad was imminent this past weekend, Gian Piero Gasperini, his opposite number at Atalanta, confirmed his hope of keeping hold of the Ivorian: ‘There is an internal solution that could be very interesting, which is Amad Diallo. Clearly, Manchester United own him, but he could remain with us for a few more months.’ Further word from a number of reliable sources over the days that followed, however, assured that fans of the Red Devils need not fret, with Diallo’s imminent arrival at Old Trafford set to go ahead as planned: Amad Diallo is now flying to Rome. He’ll complete paperworks and documents to join #mufc, then when everything will be completed [in the next few days] he’ll fly to Manchester.  #ManUtd @Amaddiallo79 pic.twitter.com/sTQ4BjBuXR — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) January 3, 2021 And, as outlined above, an insight into both the efforts of Solskjaer to convince Diallo that his best option would be to depart Atalanta immediately, and the African’s subsequent message to La Dea, has this evening been forthcoming. As revealed by transfer expert Fabrizio Romano on the ‘Here We Go’ podcast, the United boss actually made personal contact with his incoming winger via a phone call over the weekend. And, during their discussion, Solskjaer made clear: ‘I want you here, right now.’ Diallo, in turn, was left to come to a final decision on his future, with the words of his new boss having evidently hit home. The 18-year-old, during a follow-up discussion with Atalanta, is said to have thanked the Serie A outfit for their belief in his talents, but ultimately made clear his desire to immediately depart for Manchester: Amad Diallo said: “No, thanks for the opportunity. I want to go to Manchester United” to Gasperini who wanted to keep him for six more months.
