 Leaked photos of Premier League outfit Newcastle United’s home kit for next season have surfaced on social media on Friday. The kit donned by the Magpies at St. James’ Park of course rarely changes all that significantly year on year. The black and white stripes synonymous with the Geordie outfit have been a mainstay throughout the club’s history, with this past season’s edition, under Puma, having returned to a thinner, more classic look.

As revealed by the reliable Footy Headlines, the Magpies’ home kit for the season ahead features just a trio of stripes across its front. A buttoned-down collar-of-sorts will also be present, along with a large ‘FUN88’ sponsor. This comes with new manufacturer Castore evidently keen to make an impression with their debut design.
