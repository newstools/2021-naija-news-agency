 Brazil raced into a 3-0 lead in the first half of their Olympic Games opener against Germany. The fixture was the first time the two sides had met competitively since the 2014 World Cup, where Germany demolished the tournament hosts 7-1. However, six years later, Brazil are getting their own back, trouncing Germany in Tokyo. Chief architect in this was Evertonâ€™s Richarlison, who netted three times in the opening half-hour for the Selecao.

After scoring once in his seven Copa America appearances, Richarlison is now making up for lost time, and has made himself a prime contender for the golden boot already. In netting his hat-trick, Richarlison inadvertently set a new record at the Olympic Games. His three goals made him the first Premier League player to ever net a hat-trick at the event. Of course, it should be noted that often Premier League players donâ€™t travel to the Olympics as they clash with other tournaments (Such as the European Championships and the Copa America), but it remains a fantastic achievement for the Everton man. 1 â€“ Richarlisonâ€™s hat-trick for Brazil against Germany is the first treble scored by a Premier League player at the Olympic games.

However, if his pre-season form is anything to go on, he may be ready to take the Premier League by storm this campaign. Highly rated English duo to stay at Arsenal, Mikel Arteta confirms
