 England will go head to head with Italy at Wembley on Sunday night in the final of the European Championship. They have been the best two sides in the tournament and the whole nation will be behind Gareth Southgate’s men. From a slow start, the Three Lions have grown into the event, beating Denmark 2-1 after extra time in the semi-finals. Italy have looked strong throughout and will head into the clash unbeaten in 33 games. Roberto Mancini’s men needed penalties to get past Spain in their last-four encounter and the sides look evenly matched. There have been some superb performances for England, with midfield duo Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips outstanding. The pair have gone about their business of disrupting opposition attacks and protecting the back four. Bent has certainly been impressed. And he feels all club tribalism will be put aside if Harry Kane lifts the trophy in north London on Sunday night. “It’s going to be interesting to see if they do win it and the reaction when the Premier League starts to these players,” the Tooting-born former forward told talkSPORT. “You are going to see Declan Rice going to Spurs and getting a standing ovation.” Bent, 37, had a long and successful career, making 568 appearances and scoring 217 goals over a 17-year period. He played for Ipswich Town, Charlton Athletic, Tottenham, Sunderland, Aston Villa, Fulham, Brighton, Derby County and Burton Albion. Capped 11 times by England, the striker retired from professional football in 2019 and is now enjoying a career as a TV and radio pundit. And he seems to have forgotten just how partisan English football fans are and how unforgiving towards the opposition. Should England be crowned Euroepan champions, there will be massive celebrations the length and breadth of England. But, once the Premier League season gets under way, it will be back to the status quo. <img class="alignnone wp-image-1969290 size-large lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-1024x538.jpg" alt="Harry Kane celebrates scoring Ukraine v England Euro 2020" width="1024" height="538" data-srcset="https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-236x124.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1969290 size-large lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-1024x538.jpg?resize=1024%2C538&#038;ssl=1" alt="Harry Kane celebrates scoring Ukraine v England Euro 2020" width="1024" height="538" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-1024x538.jpg?resize=1024%2C538&#038;ssl=1 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-236x124.jpg 236w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-1024x538.jpg?resize=1024%2C538&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-1969290 size-large lazyload" src="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-1024x538.jpg?resize=1024%2C538&#038;ssl=1" alt="Harry Kane celebrates scoring Ukraine v England Euro 2020" width="1024" height="538" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-1024x538.jpg?resize=1024%2C538&#038;ssl=1 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/07/05082817/harry.kane-4-236x124.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1">  Rice plays for West Ham and if Bent thinks Spurs fans will roll out the red carpet he is very much mistaken. Similarly, Kane may well score the winner but he will be enemy number one when Spurs arrive at the London Stadium in 2021-2022.
