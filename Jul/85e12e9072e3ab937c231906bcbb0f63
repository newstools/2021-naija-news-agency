It was a disappointing campaign for Didier Deschamps and his side at Euro2020. In charge of the French national team, the 52-year-old boss was looking to build on their World Cup 2018 success, and looked well placed to do so after navigating their way out of Group F, which had come to be known as the “group of death”. The French impressed in their 1-0 victory over Germany, and despite draws to minnows Hungary and a seemingly beatable Portugal side, topped the group . This fact handed them a theoretically easier tie, facing Switzerland while the other two qualifying sides in their group went on to face Belgium and England. However, a minor injury crisis, which saw both left-backs unavailable against the Swiss, meant that Deschamps changed to a back three system for the first time at the tournament, something that seemingly shocked his own players. This laid in place the foundations of what proved to be a long and heartbreaking night for the French, conceding an equaliser deep into stoppage time in the second half before ultimately losing on penalties to a jubilant Swiss side. The so-called “Group of Death” – France, Germany, Portugal, Hungary – are all out of the tournament. The only group to provide no quarter-finalist. #PointlessFootballFact #EURO2020 — Greg Hands (@GregHands) July 2, 2021  Despite the disappointing exit, it seems as though Didier Deschamps is set to remain at the helm for the foreseeable future. According to French outlet Le Figaro, Noël Le Graët, the head of the French footballing federation (FFF) has already communication that Deschamps will remain in charge next year. 🎙️ Noël Le Graët – President of #FFF “If Didier Deschamps will still be the coach at the World Cup in Qatar? The answer is yes. I received it at length on Wednesday. The matter was settled in three minutes. His will to continue is very strong, mine was too.”#FRA pic.twitter.com/aJrDzmWdP3 — 6:09 Sports (@609sports) July 8, 2021  Indeed, the matter was “settled in three minutes”, suggesting that there is little bad blood surrounding France’s exit from the competition.
