 Mexico continued their dominance over the Super Eagles, scoring twice in two minutes to thrash the West African team 4-0 in a friendly match early Sunday (Nigeria time). Although Nigeria called up largely home-based players for the game at the imposing 77,500-capacity LA Coliseum, it was the sixth meeting between the two teams at the senior level. Mexico have taken the spoils thrice. The other matches ended in draws.  Two goals in the second and fourth minute and another two in the second half at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum ensured El Tri wrapped up preparations for the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup on a sound footing. Mexico dominated proceedings from the onset of the game and were justifiably rewarded when Atletico Madrid star Hector Herrera opened the scoring sheet, latching on to a corner kick from Jesus Corona. Funes Mori then doubled the lead for his side, two minutes later, directing the ball to the top left corner. The three-time African champions had no shots on target in the first half of the encounter with Miguel Herrera’s men stretching their supremacy into the second 45 minutes of the match.
