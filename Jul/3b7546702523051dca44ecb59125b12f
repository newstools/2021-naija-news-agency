Extending his gratitude to the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) for the grant awarded, Gideon Olanrewaju, the Programme Manager for the Education Digital Equity Initiative and Founder of Aid for Rural Education Access Initiative said: “I would like to thank the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) for providing us with this funding support at this material time. Our organisation is happy to have produced and disseminated a comprehensive, actionable evidence-based toolkit that will provide information access and ensure digital learning support for schools and communities to leverage digital/online learning opportunities.” Through its various proceedings, the National Digital Equity Focus Group Session focused on the roles of various actors driving meaningful digital connectivity and technology usage for improved learning access specifically on vulnerable groups. The event also presented an opportunity for different civil society and non-governmental actors to showcase and highlight what has worked for enabling remote learning for disadvantaged and also co-create ideas that are workable for the future of digital learning access at school and community levels. In his remarks, the Director, Technical Standards & Network Integrity, Bako Wakil acknowledged the need for a framework to bridge the education divide in rural and urban communities and highlighted that the Federal Government has key projects in the 774 LGAs to resolve this and other key connectivity issues. During a panel session at the event which was centered on “Education for the unreached: Issues and Opportunities”, key stakeholders in the digital inclusion, education and economy ecosystem, expressed concerns and commitment to making digital education accessible by all and for all regardless of socioeconomic status. They also emphasised the realities of digital exclusion and the corresponding negative effects of school closures during Covid-19 which was greatly exacerbated by digital inequity.
