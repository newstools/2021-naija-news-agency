 The 47-year-old has been in the Spurs hotseat since June 30. And he has little time to recruit the players he wants to take the north Londoners back into the top four. That was Jose Mourinho’s brief but a failure to inspire his charges saw the Portuguese sacked earlier this year. Nuno has many things to sort out in a short space of time, not least the future of Harry Kane. And he seems to be targeting players he knows well, having worked with both Boly and Podence while in charge at Molineux. TalkSport journalist Alex Crook claims that the Portuguese tactician is mulling over the idea of moving for the pair. Centre-back Boly has been with the West Midlanders for four years. After an initial loan spell, the Ivory Coast international penned permanent terms and is under contract with Wolves until 2023. The 30-year-old has made 136 appearances in all competitions while winning six caps for the Africans. Spurs were said to be trying to capture Jules Kounde of Sevilla but that particular door seems to have closed. And they may now turn their attention to the French-born former Porto star. “Word coming out of Spain that despite the fact that there is a willingness from Spurs to do a deal, maybe with Davinson Sanchez going the other way, he’s not keen on that move and wants to play Champions League football,” Crook said of Kounde (via Molineux News). “It could lead Nuno back to his old club Wolves. Willy Boly, according to my contacts in Portugal, possibly that Nuno would like to take from Molineux.” Podence, 25, joined Wolves from Olympiacos in January 2020. Having enjoyed nine top-flight outings in the second half of 2019-20, he played 24 times last term. The winger bagged three goals and has one cap for Portugal. Nuno brought him to the Black Country and Crook believes he may try for a reunion. <img class="alignnone wp-image-1972627 size-large lazyload"

Daniel Podence, a frustrating player in many ways because there is clearly some talent there,” he added. “But clearly a player Nuno has faith in, so there could be some kind of double raid on Wolves.” It was inevitable that Wolves players would be linked with the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium once Nuno was on board. It remains to be seen if any of the links do beat fruit, with pre-season now well underway across the land.
