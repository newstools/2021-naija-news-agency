The Attorney General in a statement on Wednesday, accused Kanu of committing heinous crimes including the alleged killing of Fulani cattle rearers, Force personnel, amongst others.  He described the Fulani herdsmen as innocent and only catering for their cattle, ScanNews reports.  He also warned members of IPOB to stay away from the next court sitting in Abuja, but added that Kanuâ€™s lawyers will be permitted around the court premises on the trial day.  Also, no branded IPOB T-shirt or caps will be allowed within the court area. Politics News  AddThis :  Original Author : Saharareporters, New York  Disable advertisements :
