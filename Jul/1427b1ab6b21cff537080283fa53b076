 The Reds brought the 25-year-old in from Preston in a shock January transfer deadline day swoop. Following season-ending injuries to Virgil van Dijk, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip, the club were short of options. As such, Klopp performed a double raid, with Ozan Kabak also joining on loan from Schalke. Liverpool only signed Davies after the player ripped up an agreement with Celtic earlier in January. While he would likely have earned more game time in Scotland, he has yet to make his debut for the Reds. Nevertheless, the Daily Mirror claims that he feels ready to fight for his place. Both Celtic and Bournemouth have registered fresh interest in offering Davies a transfer ‘escape route’, the newspaper says. However, Davies wants to prove himself under Klopp, whose desire to see him stay has inspired the decision. Despite Davies having hope over his future at Liverpool, his chances look even more restricted than they did last season. While Kabak, Nathaniel Phillips and Rhys Williams played last term, Van Dijk, Gomez and Matip have all returned to fitness. Indeed, they have joined the club’s pre-season camp ahead of the new campaign. Meanwhile, new centre-back signing Ibrahima Konate also features and will push Davies further down the pecking order. Davies only made the bench for four Premier League games last season. He did not feature in the squad for the 13 other games he was at Liverpool for last term, but injury played its part towards the end. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1920518 lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1.jpg" alt="Ben Davies Liverpool" width="1200" height="630" data-srcset="https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1.jpg 1200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-236x124.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1920518 lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ben Davies Liverpool" width="1080" height="567" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1 1200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-236x124.jpg 236w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1920518 lazyload" src="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="Ben Davies Liverpool" width="1080" height="567" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1 1200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/02/07083317/ben.davies1-236x124.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Speaking in March, Klopp insisted that he has full faith in Davies at Liverpool. The manager said: “The most famous story is maybe Andy Robertson, it took him half a year in a normal season where everything else was kind of settled to settle in. “Ben is a really good player, but he has to get used to all the stuff here as well. “We have now options and hopefully it will stay like this.” Liverpool will commence their pre-season camp in Austria on Monday.
