  The Imo State Government on Tuesday shut Rochas Foundation College, Orji, in Owerri, the state capital. The government officials arrived at the location, which is the old quarters of the staff of Imo Broadcasting Corporation and sealed it.  <img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload" typeof="foaf:Image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Okorocha-Uzodinma-1-540x303.jpg?itok=5-nOm6bG" alt=""><img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://i1.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Okorocha-Uzodinma-1-540x303.jpg?w=1080" alt data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Okorocha-Uzodinma-1-540x303.jpg?w=1080&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://i1.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Okorocha-Uzodinma-1-540x303.jpg?w=1080" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1">   Rochas Okorocha owns the college. It was observed that the state government had taken over the massive property. The Senior Special Assistant to the Governor of Imo State on Print Media, Modestus Nwamkpa, who confirmed the development, said the governor, Hope Uzodinma, was committed to recovering properties of the state allegedly “looted by Okorocha and his family members.” Nwamkpa said that the governor was implementing the recommendations of various White Papers by committees set up by the state government. The governor’s aide confirmed the seal off “is true,” adding that “Governor Hope Uzodinma is committed to recovering all the properties of the state stolen. This is not a personal war it is just the implementation of the recommendations of the whitepapers of the various committees set up the government.” But Okorocha’s spokesperson, Sam Onwuemeodo, when contacted, said that Okorocha’s enormous political capacity jolted Uzodinma. Speaking with Punch, Okorocha’s aide said, “This is the fourth time Imo State Government has announced sealing that place. EFCC had also announced that they had closed it but the truth is that Uzodinma should wake up. There is hunger in the state. “This is just the renewal of his war against Okorocha after Okorocha and other strong APC chieftains in Imo State visited APC National Secretariat. Each time Uzodinma realizes that the people are not happy with his style of governance, he uses Okorocha’s name to distract the people but the truth is poverty and hunger pervade the atmosphere. He should be humble enough to consult Okorocha on how to govern the state.” Politics News  AddThis :  Original Author : SaharaReporters, New York  Disable advertisements :
