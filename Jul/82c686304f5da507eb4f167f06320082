  A former Chairman of the defunct Congress Progressives Change, Rufai Hanga, has alleged that the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress and former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, prevented Tunde Bakare from running with President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. In 2011, Bakare ran with Buhari for Presidency but they lost. In 2015, Buhari ran alongside Yemi Osinbajo and secured victory.  <img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload" typeof="foaf:Image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Bola-Ahmed-Tinubu (2).jpeg?itok=10ITq9lp" alt=""><img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Bola-Ahmed-Tinubu (2).jpeg?itok=10ITq9lp" alt data-lazy-src="https://secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Bola-Ahmed-Tinubu%20(2).jpeg?itok=10ITq9lp&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Bola-Ahmed-Tinubu (2).jpeg?itok=10ITq9lp" alt="">Bola Tinubu   Both of them were reelected in 2019. In an interview with Daily Trust, Hanga stated that Buhari wanted to run with Bakare again in 2015 but Tinubu stopped that by bringing Osinbajo. He said, “There was a time that we wanted to merge with Tinubu’s party, the ACN, ahead of the 2011 election. These people went and told Buhari everything and that he shouldn’t accept anything from Tinubu. “Instead of Buhari to pick a running mate, El-Rufai brought Tunde Bakare as running mate to Buhari. And Tinubu was annoyed, backed out and he (Buhari) failed. “Everything went like that. But we polled 12million votes. Then people were saying that if Buhari could poll such votes, then he must be a strong ally.  Later Tinubu came to Buhari and said, ‘Sir, they must have told you certain things about me. I agree that I am a bad boy but we will produce results for you. It is not prayers. Politics is a game. We will do it and succeed but we must abide by the agreement.’ Buhari agreed. But the spin doctors continued to mount pressure. Tunde Bakare was to be picked again but Tinubu stopped it and the present vice president was brought in.” Hanga alleged that the APC is plotting to rig the 2023 elections. He also stressed that despite the role he played in the emergence of Buhari as the President of Nigeria, some powerful persons blocked him from reaping the reward of his labour.
