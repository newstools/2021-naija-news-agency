Some of them wore customised shirts with Biafra boldly written on them. It was observed that they made use of the public address system while observing social distancing in line with COVID-19 protocols.The protest had been announced a few days earlier with the announcement asking protesters to gather by 10 am on July 9. SahahaReporters has earlier reported the Kanu’s lawyer, Aloy Ejimakor said the British High Commission in Nigeria had acknowledged the receipt of the letter written on behalf of the IPOB Leader, Kanu, seeking its support as a British citizen. Ejimakor on Tuesday said the British authorities guaranteed the protection of Kanu’s welfare. He said the letter specifically stated that Kanu will get the “support and welfare” of the British authorities. Kanu through Ejimakor had petitioned the British High Commission, requesting “That Mr Kanu be granted every possible Consular Assistance to which he is entitled as a British citizen.”  Politics News  AddThis :  Original Author : SaharaReporters, New York  Disable advertisements :
