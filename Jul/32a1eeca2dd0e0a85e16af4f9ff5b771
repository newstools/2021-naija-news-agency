Pedri might be one of the most exciting young talents on the planet right now, so much so his parent club are looking to do all they can to not see him overworked. Having already qualified for the Euro squad this summer and playing consistently at the tournament, Spain have also drafted him in for the Tokyo Olympics squad. 🙌🏻 ¡¡VAMOS A POR EL ORO!! 🙌🏻 🇪🇸 Estos son los internacionales que representarán a España en #Tokyo2020. 👥 Los jugadores convocados por Luis de la Fuente comenzarán la concentración este miércoles 30 de junio. 🔗 https://t.co/Y2ll0GhvdE#SomosEspaña pic.twitter.com/0iGJs1IBOm — Selección Española de Fútbol (@SeFutbol) June 29, 2021  Something which Barcelona are not too pleased with. He would likely miss the start of the new season to recover and will be pivotal in the Blaugrana’s title push this campaign. They appealed the decision but were unsuccessful in their attempts according to Marca. That has been the reason that has pushed Barcelona to take steps to try to get the RFEF to rethink the call for the canary and remove him from the list so that he could rest. A decision that the Federation has already said they will not take. Pedri will be in Japan. The annual Golden Boy Awards are an opportunity to highlight some of the greatest footballing talents from the youngest players on the biggest stages. The award has seen the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland, Sergio Aguero and Mario Balotelli all reign triumphant. Some have gone on to do great things and others have struggled to maintain their early momentum. For this year’s awards there are two standout candidates in the form of Barcelona and Spain midfielder Pedri and Borussia Dortmund and England midfielder Jude Bellingham. Before the Euros, both were seen as great prospects for the trophy but the tournament has seen the Spaniard take the lead. #FCB🔵🔴 🔝La brillante Eurocopa de Pedri tras una temporada ya de por sí excelsa le coloca en la ‘pole’ 👀Jude Bellingham se antoja como su gran rival, aunque el inglés suma solo 30 minutos en lo que va de Euro ✍️ @tjuanmarti https://t.co/XtYLHr7q2O — Diario SPORT (@sport) July 3, 2021  With both Declan Rice and Kalvin Phillips on yellow cards in the quarter-final, a yellow against Ukraine would see them suspended for the semi-final should they qualify. This could open the door to Bellingham getting some minutes. Yet Pedri still appears very much the star tipped to lift the title of Golden Boy this year.
