 The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday confirmed that a rare case of human monkeypox was detected in Texas, making it the first case of the virus seen in the state. The viral illness was found in a U.S. resident, who recently travelled from Nigeria to the U.S. and is currently hospitalised in Dallas. He is in stable condition, according to the health department’s statement. “While rare, this case is not a reason for alarm and we do not expect any threat to the general public,” Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said. Other than Nigeria, outbreaks have also been reported in Central and West African countries since 1970, with a large outbreak in people in the U.S. in 2003, according to the CDC. Monkeypox, which belongs to the same family of viruses as smallpox, is a rare but potentially serious viral illness. It can spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. The CDC said since travellers were wearing masks due to COVID-19, the risk of spread of monkeypox via respiratory droplets to others on air planes and at the airports was low.
