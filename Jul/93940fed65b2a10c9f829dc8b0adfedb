 Speaking during a programme on Channels Television on Wednesday, the Taraba governor said at the end of the military training, ex-corps members would be able to carry guns to defend themselves. He noted that since the government cannot provide adequate security, citizens should be engaged to protect themselves. “If you leave me, the NYSC, I will say it should be two years — one year for compulsory military training and the other year for the social works that they are doing now,” he said. This is so that anybody who graduates as an NYSC person can know how to handle a gun, can know how to defend himself, just like it is done in other countries like in Israel, Lebanon and other places. You must engage your citizens to be proactive when you cannot provide security. You must allow them to protect themselves. Constitution or no constitution, you must first be alive. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-10394 lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://mlpthjcvvzze.i.optimole.com/l57LFPo.2zvi~5f0f9/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://i0.wp.com/ebitu.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-05-05-at-1.47.18-AM.png?resize=151,47&amp;ssl=1" alt="EBITU | #EbituBlog" width="151" height="47" data-recalc-dims="1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-10394 lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i1.wp.com/mlpthjcvvzze.i.optimole.com/l57LFPo.2zvi~5f0f9/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://i0.wp.com/ebitu.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-05-05-at-1.47.18-AM.png?resize=151%2C47&#038;ssl=1" alt="EBITU | #EbituBlog" width="151" height="47" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/mlpthjcvvzze.i.optimole.com/l57LFPo.2zvi~5f0f9/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://i0.wp.com/ebitu.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-05-05-at-1.47.18-AM.png?resize=151%2C47&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img class="alignnone  wp-image-10394 lazyload" src="https://i1.wp.com/mlpthjcvvzze.i.optimole.com/l57LFPo.2zvi~5f0f9/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://i0.wp.com/ebitu.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Screenshot-2021-05-05-at-1.47.18-AM.png?resize=151%2C47&#038;ssl=1" alt="EBITU | #EbituBlog" width="151" height="47" data-recalc-dims="1" data-recalc-dims="1"> The post NYSC should be 2 years.
