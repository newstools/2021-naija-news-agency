  President Muhammadu Buhari has slammed those calling for the sovereignty of the Biafra and Oduduwa Republics, saying they are ignorant. Buhari said he expected them to be thinking of how to be suggesting initiatives to attract investors to the country.  <img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://i2.wp.com/secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Land-Boarders-News-Buhari-1.jpeg?w=1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1">President Buhari   The President said this on Thursday during a live interview with Arise TV, monitored by SaharaReporters.  The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), led by Nnamdi Kanu has been clamouring for the sovereign nation of Biafra as a result of alleged marginalisation, killings and hatred being shown to Igbo people.  In the same manner, Oyo-based rights activist and businessman, Sunday Igboho has gained massive support in the South-West in his demand for Oduduwa Republic for Yoruba people.  Buhari during the interview said those agitators are delusional in their thinking as they neglect the issue of resources for Nigerians to survive.  “Yes, I think of Nigeria. Nigerians can say what they want to say. They want their republics. They don’t think about resources. How to share what we have.  “They don’t think (of) how to win the confidence of investors. I think they allow their ignorance to disorganise the country,” Buhari said. Politics News  AddThis :  Original Author : Saharareporters, New York  Disable advertisements :
