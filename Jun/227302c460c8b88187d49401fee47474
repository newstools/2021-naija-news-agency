  The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Saturday, says the shutting down of Twitter in Nigeria has exposed President Muhammadu Buhari’s plan to Islamize the country. Nigeria’s information and culture minister Lai Mohammed had announced Twitter’s suspension in a statement by his media aide, Segun Adeyemi.  <img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://i1.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/000621083W.jpeg?w=1080" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1">   The suspension by the Nigerian government comes days after a post by President Muhammadu Buhari on the 1967 civil war was deleted by the microblogging platform. The suspension of the social networking service was also shared on the Twitter handle of the Federal Ministry of Information, which has since generated reactions from some Nigerians on Twitter. The Nigerian government’s spokesman cited “the persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence” as the reason for the suspension. Reacting in a statement by its spokesperson, Emma Powerful, IPOB said the ban on the microblogging platform in Nigeria confirmed that Nigeria was under “hostage by Islamic fundamentalists and terror apologists.” The separatist group described President Buhari as a tyrant. “This wicked action of the Fulani-controlled federal government is nothing but a confirmation that Nigeria is under hostage by Islamic fundamentalists and terror apologists. “This is further proof that Buhari is a tyrant and dictator whose only agenda is to Fulanise and Islamise Nigeria. “The tyrant Buhari was not the only President to be sanctioned by Twitter for posting hate speech but none of them ever shut down the platform in their country. As powerful as the former US President Donald Trump was, he never ordered the pulling down of Twitter platform from the US when the social media giant suspended his account,” the group said.
