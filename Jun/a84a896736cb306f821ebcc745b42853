 Arsenal have reportedly contacted Manchester United to ask about the future of midfielder Donny van de Beek. After a disastrous debut season at Old Trafford, van de Beek is reportedly looking for a way to end his Old Trafford nightmare. window.dojoRequire(["mojo/signup-forms/Loader"], function(L) { L.start({"baseUrl":"mc.us2.list-manage.com","uuid":"0dbf0c85a1d332bd7bb792371","lid":"9014791a03","uniqueMethods":true}) }) And according to a report in the Daily Express, the Gunners have offered him exactly that. Indeed, they have already made contact with the player’s representatives in a bid to lure him to the Emirates. The Dutchman only joined United last summer in a deal worth up to £40m. However, he spent much of his first campaign sat on the bench and notched just one Premier League goal for the club. With Solskjaer seemingly unconvinced that the midfielder will come good, it appears the Red Devils are ready to cut their losses. Mikel Arteta is expected to freshen up his midfield this summer, with Dani Ceballos heading back to Real Madrid. Matteo Guendouzi and Granit Xhaka are also expected to be sold – leaving the door open for the addition of van de Beek. Van de Beek already has some ties to Arsenal. He is currently in a long-term relationship with the daughter of Gunners legend Dennis Bergkamp. Offloading the Holland star will also allow United to step up their interest in Atletico midfielder Saul Niguez. The Spain international is interesting a number of clubs, including Liverpool and Man City. However, the Red Devils are thought to be one of the major frontrunners for his signature.
