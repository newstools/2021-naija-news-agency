The Nigerian government’s spokesman cited “the persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence” as the reason for the suspension. In what appeared as solidarity with her husband’s administration, Aisha, who joined Twitter in February 2016, and has over one million followers on Friday, said she was deleting her account. “I will be deactivating my Twitter account for now. Long live the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” she tweeted. The Nigerian First Lady had gone off the radar around September 2020, shortly after the flamboyant wedding of her daughter, Hanan and her groom, Mohammed Turad.  <img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Screenshot 2021-06-05 at 1.41.22 AM.png?itok=U31XMOrn" alt="">   Apart from the luxury on display, event planners for the wedding were flown in from the United Arab Emirates to add colour and spice to the ceremony. Earlier in August 2020, the First Lady was also reported to have flown to Dubai in a private jet owned by billionaire Mohammed Indimi under the guise of going for a medical emergency but to shop for luxury items ahead of the wedding. Most of the items, including souvenirs used for the wedding, were brought in from the foreign country.
