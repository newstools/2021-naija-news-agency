  Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, has described a report circulating on social media that he has been arrested by the Department of State Services (DSS) as false. The report had claimed the senator was arrested at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, where he had gone to attend a function.  <img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload" typeof="foaf:Image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/abaribe.jpg?itok=xq8WTyGX" alt=""><img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://i0.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/abaribe.jpg?w=1080" alt data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/abaribe.jpg?w=1080&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://i0.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/abaribe.jpg?w=1080" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1">   Reacting through his spokesman, Uche Awon, Abaribe said he was not arrested nor accosted by security operatives. “It’s not true, we are here in the office together, I’m with the senator here. Some guys are mismanaging social media, because this thing pops up to remind them that he was arrested three years ago. “Three years ago, he was arrested, today is the anniversary of it. So somebody just quickly claimed he has been arrested. The senator is here in his office,” his media aide told SaharaReporters. Abaribe has been very critical of President Muhammadu Buhari and his administration’s policies in the last six years. Abaribe earlier in the week wore a T-shirt branded: ‘The Dot Nation’. This was clearly in reference to a statement made by President Muhammadu Buhari earlier in June when he described the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) as a dot nation with limited access. “So that IPOB is just like a dot in a circle. Even if they want to exit, they’ll have no access to anywhere. And the way they are spread all over the country, having businesses and properties. I don’t think IPOB knows what they are talking about,” he said. Politics News  AddThis :  Original Author : SaharaReporters, New York  Disable advertisements :
