 Liverpool are keeping close tabs on Real Sociedad and Sweden striker Alexander Isak ahead of a potential swoop, according to a report. The 21-year-old has been around some of Europe’s top leagues since his move to Borussia Dortmund in January 2017. But despite a brief run in the team in the 2017/18 campaign, he did not follow that up in 2018/19. Instead, he moved to Dutch side Willem II, scoring a 13 goals in 16 Erevidisie games. Dortmund subsequently cashed in on his form in summer 2019 and he has proved a fantastic signing for Sociedad, scoring 33 goals in 89 games. He scored 17 times in 34 La Liga games last term but raised his profile further with a fantastic display against Spain – albeit without scoring – in his country’s opening Euro 2020 clash. Arsenal have had transfer links with Isak recently, but according to Noticias de Gipuzkoa, Liverpool have now come into view as candidates for his signing. Reds chiefs have compiled ‘excellent’ reports on the 6ft 4in striker, who is on ‘everyone’s lips’ at Euro 2020. What’s more, Liverpool reportedly see Isak as the replacement in the near future for Roberto Firmino. The Brazilian remains a key part of Jurgen Klopp’s team, but his contract runs out in 2023 and it remains unclear if he will renew. Isak has three years left on his Soceidad deal, which also features a €70million (£60million) release clause. The La Liga club attempted to raise the exit fee but could not do so before Euro 2020 began. Firmino still forms part of Liverpool’s long-term attacking trio alongside Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane. But as well as Isak, RB Salzburg’s Patson Daka is reportedly another target for the club to add fresh options.
