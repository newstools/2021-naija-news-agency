 Mikel Oyarzabal is a product of Real Sociedad’s youth system and has so far spent his entire senior career at the club. In that time the 24-year-old has developed into one of La Liga’s top wingers. All told, Oyarzabal has featured 239 times across all competitions for Sociedad, scoring 64 and assisting 45 in the process. 2020/21 was a particularly impressive campaign for the Spaniard. He would score 11 and assist eight in 33 La Liga ties, earning himself a spot in Spain’s Euro 2020 squad. Oyarzabal is also quite versatile and though he prefers to play on the left flank, he can also operate on the right. Now, Oyarzabal, who is contracted to Real until 2024, appears to be attracting interest from a top Premier League side. According to Sport Witness, citing Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, Man City chief Txiki Begiristain is said to have a ‘special fixation’ with Oyarzabal.
