 Napoli star Lorenzo Insigne has, on Thursday, provided an insight into Gennaro Gattuso’s decision turn down the chance to manage Tottenham Hotspur. Ongoings on the white half of North London have of course taken centre stage in the media over the last couple of weeks. This comes amid the Lilywhites’ ongoing efforts to appoint a new manager ahead of the 2021/22 campaign. Since the decision was made to dismiss Jose Mourinho back in April, a whole host of tacticians from across the continent have been tipped to take up the reins at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. To this point, however, the efforts of Daniel Levy and co. have proven fruitless. One such manager to have entered into discussions with Spurs’ board over the position last week was former AC Milan and Italy midfielder Gennaro Gattuso. The 43-year-old was actually expected to take up the reins at Serie A outfit Fiorentina ahead of next season, but a last-minute disagreement over transfer strategy saw Gattuso, at the last minute, turn his back on the Viola. Gennaro Gattuso is set to leave Fiorentina with immediate effect just 20 days after he’s been appointed, confirmed. ❌🟣 #Fiorentina Problems on transfers strategy between Fiorentina board, Gattuso’s agent Jorge Mendes and Gennaro himself. They’re now working to part ways. https://t.co/iiXPKhx1uC — Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) June 16, 2021  In turn, the arrival of fellow countryman Fabio Paratici at Tottenham saw the Premier League giants attempt to take advantage of Gattuso’s renewed availability, with negotiations between the parties having gotten underway on a week ago today. Just 24 hours later, however, word was forthcoming that an agreement would not be forthcoming, after Paratici and Levy opted to turn their attentions elsewhere. If the latest word doing the rounds in the media on Thursday is anything to go by, however, then it appears that Gattuso may not have been overly keen on testing his talents in the English capital, anyway. Speaking to reporters whilst on international duty at Euro 2020, Lorenzo Insigne was drawn on his former boss at Napoli remaining out of work, despite holding talks with Spurs. And the Italian wide-man went on to confirm that he has discussed Gattuso’s failed negotiations with the tactician himself, with ‘a bit of a mess’ in North London having been cited as behind the parties eventually opting to go their separate ways: ‘We’ve texted each other, he told me there was a bit of mess, but now I am focused on the Euros, while he’s on holiday so I am not going to ask him such questions.’
