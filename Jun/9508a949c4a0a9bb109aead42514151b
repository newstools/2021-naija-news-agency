Obasanjo said, “My prayer is that all of us will have something to contribute to making this country what God has created it to be – a land flowing with milk and honey. “Right now, it is a land flowing with bitterness and sadness, that is not what God wants this country to be. “We must change the narrative, we must talk to ourselves in the civilised language. “There is nowhere you go in this country that you will not see geniuses in any section of the country.
