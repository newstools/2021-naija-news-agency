Manchester United’s 2020/21 had the potential to be great, but would end on a rather sour note. The Red Devils would clinch 2nd spot in the league, an improvement on their finish the campaign prior. However, United still finished 12 points off 1st place Manchester City and their points total of 74 was seven lower than what Jose Mourinho was able to manage back in the 2017/18 season, with that total of 81 remaining United’s highest in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era. Elsewhere, Man United were knocked out of the FA Cup in the quarter-finals and exited the League Cup at the semi-final stage. The remaining competition Man United found themselves in was the Europa League after they were only able to finish 3rd in their Champions League group. United did make it to the final of the second-tier European competition, but were eventually beaten by Villareal. So, Man United remain trophyless under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and have shown little progress in terms of their points totals in the league. Despite this, Fred recently voiced his opinion that though they wanted to win more, United had a great season: “Definitely, for me the team’s done really well and been growing over the season. We didn’t start that well as we didn’t have a pre-season. We had the Europa League semi-final which prolonged last season. “We didn’t have a pre-season and got better and better over the season and reached the final. I think overall the team’s had a great season, we could have achieved more, we wanted to win more trophies, but I think generally it’s been a great season.” Quotes via Manchester United’s official website. 10 best defenders to pick for your Euro Fantasy Football team 10 best midfielders to pick for your Euro Fantasy Football team 10 best striker options in Euro 2020 Fantasy Football
