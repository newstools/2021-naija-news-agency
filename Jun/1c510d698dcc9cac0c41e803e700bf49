 The British technology entrepreneur reportedly committed suicide by hanging on Wednesday afternoon June 23, in a prison cell, just hours after a preliminary ruling for his extradition to the United States on charges of tax evasion. The Catalan justice department confirmed in a statement that the likely cause of death is a suicide, Reuters reported. Employees at the Brians 2 penitentiary tried to revive the 75-year-old Mr McAfee but were unsuccessful, according to a statement cited by Spanish newspaper El Mundo and reporting by the Associated Press. According to the newspaper El Pais, the software entrepreneur was arrested in October and was awaiting extradition to the US when he was found dead. McAfee had been charged with several federal financial crimes in two US districts. In the Western District of Tennessee, Mr McAfee was indicted in October on ten counts of allegedly evading taxes on millions of dollars of income. In a Manhattan federal court in March, he was charged for a scheme involving cryptocurrency, which he was pushing on social media. The charges for his tax evasion carried a 30-year prison sentence. A statement from the regional Catalan government didn’t identify the American tycoon by name but said he was a 75-year-old US citizen awaiting extradition to the country. The paper added that police are investigating the circumstances surrounding his death. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-9902 lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://mlpthjcvvzze.i.optimole.com/qdpMrCw.2zvi~5f0f9/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://i2.wp.com/ebitu.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_2021-04-11_at_3.10.45_PM-removebg-preview.png?resize=102,39&amp;ssl=1" alt="EBITU | #EbituBlog" width="102" height="39" data-recalc-dims="1"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9902 lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" src="https://i1.wp.com/mlpthjcvvzze.i.optimole.com/qdpMrCw.2zvi~5f0f9/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://i2.wp.com/ebitu.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_2021-04-11_at_3.10.45_PM-removebg-preview.png?resize=102%2C39&#038;ssl=1" alt="EBITU | #EbituBlog" width="102" height="39" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/mlpthjcvvzze.i.optimole.com/qdpMrCw.2zvi~5f0f9/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://i2.wp.com/ebitu.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_2021-04-11_at_3.10.45_PM-removebg-preview.png?resize=102%2C39&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img class="alignnone  wp-image-9902 lazyload" src="https://i1.wp.com/mlpthjcvvzze.i.optimole.com/qdpMrCw.2zvi~5f0f9/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://i2.wp.com/ebitu.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_2021-04-11_at_3.10.45_PM-removebg-preview.png?resize=102%2C39&#038;ssl=1" alt="EBITU | #EbituBlog" width="102" height="39" data-recalc-dims="1" data-recalc-dims="1"> The post John McAfee, Founder Of Antivirus Company McAfee; found dead in Prison appeared first on E B I T U™.
