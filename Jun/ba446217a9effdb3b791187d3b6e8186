 Sancho was United’s top target last summer, but they failed to meet Dortmund’s asking price. The winger has never faded off their radar, though, and now could be the time to make their move again. Dortmund’s demands have dropped, although they still want any deal to be done on their terms. Hence, United will still have to convince them in negotiations, but those talks are ongoing. According to Sky Sports News and The Athletic, there is increasing confidence from United’s part that they can sign Sancho. Sky claim all parties are “cautiously optimistic” of completing a deal for the 21-year-old. Personal terms will not be a problem, leaving it between the clubs to find a compromise. The report suggests the key area to determine from the talks is how much United will pay, and how they will pay it. Dortmund’s asking price is not revealed, but they will only sell if it is met by a certain date. Last summer, they set United a deadline of before their pre-season training camp began to meet their demands for Sancho. The Red Devils ultimately failed to reach those requirements. The Athletic warn that the two clubs once again are “apart” on Sancho’s valuation and Dortmund’s demands may not be as low as first thought. However, they too claim that there are greater “expectations” of an agreement being found. United reportedly want to spend around £80m on Sancho, which still falls around £20m below what Dortmund want. But there is a better chance of a compromise this summer than there was last year. The Premier League side could make up the remaining amount by including add-ons, for example. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1935326" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PA.58438700-1-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="Jadon Sancho TEAMtalk" width="1080" height="567" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PA.58438700-1-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1 1200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/20084929/PA.58438700-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/20084929/PA.58438700-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/20084929/PA.58438700-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/20084929/PA.58438700-1-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/20084929/PA.58438700-1-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/20084929/PA.58438700-1-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/20084929/PA.58438700-1-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/20084929/PA.58438700-1-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/20084929/PA.58438700-1-236x124.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-recalc-dims="1"> If United do find an agreement with Dortmund, then things should escalate quickly. It has been reported that Sancho has almost agreed personal terms, since he was in communication with the club last summer. Late last month, it was claimed that his entourage now expect him to move on from the Bundesliga club. There are other suitors as well as United, but they still seem to be in pole position. Sancho scored eight goals and provided 11 assists from 26 appearances in the 2020-21 Bundesliga.
