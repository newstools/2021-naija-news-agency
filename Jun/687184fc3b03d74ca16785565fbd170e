The lower court had ruled that the EFCC proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and consequently convicted and sentenced Adamu to a cumulative 31 years imprisonment on the 7 counts preferred against him. Adamu was convicted for awarding a contract to a non-existing company, inflation of contract, and payment of contractor above his threshold. “But dissatisfied with the ruling of the court, Adamu approached the Court of Appeal, to set aside the judgment of the trial court. “However, the Appellate Court resolved the appeal in favour of the EFCC, affirming the judgment of the lower court, including the consequential order on the refund of N31, 640,000.00 (Thirty-one million, six hundred and forty thousand naira).
