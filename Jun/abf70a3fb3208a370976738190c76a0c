Spain have been forced to hand debuts to ten players for their friendly clash against Lithuania this evening. Coronavirus concerns meant that the entire senior squad was out of action just 3 days ahead of Euro2020 beginning. Due to this, La Furia Roja have fielded their under-21 side, who are fresh off the back of European Championships disappointment having lost 1-0 to Portugal at the semi-final stage. OFICIAL | ¡¡YA TENEMOS EL ONCE TITULAR!! Estos son los jugadores elegidos por Luis de la Fuente para saltar de inicio al césped de Butarque. ¡¡A por la victoria, equipo!! #SomosEspaña pic.twitter.com/1KQlZy03uE — Selección Española de Fútbol (@SeFutbol) June 8, 2021  Of these players, only Bryan Gil has made an appearance for the senior side before, meaning that ten players (and any that come off the bench) will be making their debuts for their national side. The reason for this precaution was Sergio Busquet’s positive COVID test result on Sunday, which meant that the entire first-team squad was forced to isolate. It is not yet known whether any further positive results have since appeared, although a post on the National side’s official website noted that all tested negative on Sunday. What this means for Spain’s European Championships remains to be seen. They are due to play Sweden in their opening Group E fixture on 14th June, less than a week from now. Whilst Sergio Busquets, national team captain in Sergio Ramos’ absence, will surely miss the opening fixture at least, the repercussions may yet be even more severe if more players test positive. The Spanish federation have also agreed to refund match-goers for the game against Lithuania completely if they decide not to go, or by 20% if they decide to watch the U21 side anyway.
