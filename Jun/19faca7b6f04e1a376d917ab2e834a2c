 The Dutch looked to have blown a 2-0 lead when they were pegged back in their Euro 2020 opener. However, Everton target Denzel Dumfries powered home a late header to give Frank de Boer’s men all three points in Amsterdam. Crystal Palace defender van Aanholt started the game, but was hauled off in the 64th minute. And it’s fair to say that Neville does not rate him. “He’s wrong side. It’s typical of Van Aanholt. He’s a poor defender,” Neville said in ITV Sport’s coverage, in the build-up to Andriy Yarmolenko’s run into the Dutch area. The 30-year-old is one of a number of Dutch players who have allowed their contracts to expire this summer. Liverpool star Gini Wijnaldum is heading to PSG. Memphis Depay, meanwhile, is expected to join Barcelona when his Lyon deal expires. Give our social media channels a follow – we’re on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram Van Aanholt is another player looking for a new club this summer, with the Gunners and Leeds strongly linked. Arsenal are looking at the Holland star as cover for Kieran Tierney, while Leeds remain unclear over Ezgjan Alioski’s long-term future. Salary demands could be an issue, however, with Van Aanholt earning £55,000-a-week at Selhurst Park. Moving on a free, the player would expect an increase in that figure, as well as a bumper signing-on fee. However, judging by Neville’s comments both clubs should avoid a deal at all costs.
