Igboho had also declared that the Southwest part was no longer part of Nigeria. During his declaration, the self-acclaimed activist said the major resources of Nigeria are in the hands of Northerners, stressing that Yorubas were being killed and their land was taken over. Aregbesola, while speaking at Zenabab Hotel, Ilesha, Osun State, during his 64th birthday celebration on Saturday, warned the agitators to consider the women, children, older people and those living with disabilities, TheNation reports. He noted that Nigeria would liberate Africa from all oppressions; therefore, Nigerians must not support secessionists. “Anything that threatens and creates a problem for Nigeria may cause backwardness for our country for 50 years,” he added.
