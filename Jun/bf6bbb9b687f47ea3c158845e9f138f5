As part of Dentsu International’s accelerated transformation programme (ATP), Posterscope Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana will be rebooting to Dentsu location services (DLS) as the out-of-home (OOH) business in the countries to boost revenue. “We wish to highlight that the reboot will not affect Posterscope’s award-winning credentials or the day-to-day running of the business. Under Dentsu location services we will continue to deliver world-class and best technology-driven solutions to our clients as well as focus on growing our capabilities and talent across the region,” said Dawn Rowlands, CEO, Dentsu SSA. Also speaking, Emeka Okeke, GCEO, MediaFuse, Dentsu said: “The rebooting is strategically done at a time like this to strengthen what we currently offer as Posterscope and allows us to leverage our group’s investment in location data to serve our client even better”.
