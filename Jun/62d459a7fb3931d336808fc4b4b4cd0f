 Mikel Arteta’s perfect defensive signing this summer is Jules Kounde, according to The Athletic. Arteta is on the lookout for a new defender after David Luiz’s exit. Sevilla centre-back Jules Kounde, who is also on the wanted list of Manchester United, is understood to be on the Gunners’ radar. However, Arsenal face a struggle to get the 22-year-old to The Emirates without Champions League football. Kounde also has a £69m release clause in his contract, which could also prevent Arsenal from getting serious about an approach for the France international. However, the report claims Sevilla would be open to offers for the player. Whether Arsenal have the financial muscle to compete for Kounde is open to debate. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1931320" src="https://i0.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PA.58459760.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="Kingsley Coman TEAMtalk" width="1080" height="567" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/PA.58459760.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1 1200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/08105825/PA.58459760-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/08105825/PA.58459760-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/08105825/PA.58459760-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/08105825/PA.58459760-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/08105825/PA.58459760-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/08105825/PA.58459760-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/08105825/PA.58459760-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/08105825/PA.58459760-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/03/08105825/PA.58459760-236x124.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Man Utd are prepared to bid for Bayern Munich’s French winger Kingsley Coman, 24, if Dortmund play hardball over a move for Sancho.
