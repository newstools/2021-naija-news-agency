 Right-back has emerged as one of United football director John Murtough’s priorities over the coming months. In fact, he has received word from manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer about concerns for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. While the 23-year-old is a fantastic defender, Solskjaer feels uneasy about his attacking contributions. As such, England Euro 2020 star Trippier has re-emerged on United’s radar, after January interest. Indeed, Solskjaer looks to left-back Luke Shaw’s resurgence since Alex Telles came in as reason to bolster down the right. Murtough reportedly failed with his first bid, which came in at £10million. Subsequent claims have said that Atletico want £30million for Trippier. According to Gazzetta dello Sport (June 14, pg 13), though, United have made the Spanish club think with a €25million (£21.5million) bid. Boss Simeone is beginning to ‘evaluate’ Trippier’s exit, with the Old Trafford club waiting for a response. The report adds, though, that with the right-back’s release clause set at €40million (£34million), Atletico chiefs are taking time to see if any bigger offers come in. Trippier enjoyed a strong season for Atletico, making 35 appearances in all competitions. That is despite a suspension midway through the campaign. As a result, he is one of three right-backs in Gareth Southgate’s team, after Trent Alexander-Arnold’s withdrawal. Trippier has two years left on his deal which he signed after deciding to leave Tottenham in 2019. Overall, he has played 68 games for Atletico, notching 11 assists in that time. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1961744" src="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/09120332/Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1" width="1080" height="567" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/09120332/Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1.jpg?resize=1080%2C567&#038;ssl=1 1200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/09120332/Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/09120332/Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/09120332/Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/09120332/Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/09120332/Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/09120332/Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/09120332/Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/09120332/Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/09120332/Raphael-Varane-Benzema-Real-Madrid-TEAMtalk-1-236x124.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" data-recalc-dims="1"> United could also add a centre-back to their ranks this summer, despite winger Jadon Sancho being their top transfer priority. As the Red Devils go after Trippier, Raphael Varane from Atletico’s rivals Real Madrid could be available. His future remains unclear but with only one year left on his deal, now is the time for Madrid to sell if he does choose to move on.
