By the bride-to-be, Mando I remember the day Kenneth and I met so vividly. It was back in January 2016 and I was coming from the gym after an intensive workout. So I decided to treat myself to some shopping at one of my favourite stores in Alberton Mall, South Africa. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303998" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings18-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304000" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings20-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303999" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings19-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"> I was alone, looking tired and crusty. All of a sudden this guy comes over with a bunch of clothes on his hands and he was following me around the store. He came up to me and forged an accent. <img src="https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f602.png?w=1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="üòÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1"> He asked for my number and introduced himself. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304001" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings21-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303994" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings14-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304006" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings26-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"> I just starred at him cause in disbelief. He was looking really cute I must admit. I formed hard to get and started walking out of the store and he followed me with his hands full of clothes! <img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f648.png?w=1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="üôà" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1"> I just stood because I thought about him getting arrested over stealing from the store. He insisted on getting my number and I reluctantly gave him. I didn‚Äôt expect him to call at all. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304005" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings25-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304002" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings22-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304003" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings23-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"> A week or so later I got a text from a strange number. Lo and behold, it was my mystery shopper. The first thing I said was ‚Äò I thought you‚Äôd never call‚Äô. We had a nice chat and set to meet up on the weekend. I saved his name as King- I thought that‚Äôs what he said because of his American accent. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304004" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings24-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"> We had our first meet up at the same mall and boy must I admit he was looking even more handsome. He didn‚Äôt want to eat- so he had a milkshake (a strange option for a guy on a first date). I ate food <img src="https://i1.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f61b.png?w=1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="üòõ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1">while he sipped on his milkshake and we decided to go to the movies. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304007" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings27-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304011" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings31-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304010" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings30-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"> A year after we started dating, boo had to move back to Nigeria and we promised to keep dating. It was not easy at all because the distance was too much and communication was sometimes an issue. We both went silent on each other but didn‚Äôt end the relationship. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304012" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings32-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304009" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings29-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304014" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings34-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"> I couldn‚Äôt move on‚Ä¶ it was hard. God knows I prayed for this man! For the distance to go away and for us to be together. In December 2017, boo asked me to come over to Nigeria. It was only January 2018 that we saw after almost over a year of being apart. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304013" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings33-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304008" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings28-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"> We agreed we‚Äôd try our best to make things work and boy it was not easy! Seeing each other only once or twice a year but we endured. He proposed to me on his birthday on my second visit to Nigeria in 2019 and we prayed and believed that we‚Äôd get married that same year. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1304015" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303983" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings3-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303981" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings1-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"> However, things weren‚Äôt working out the way we planned. This put a huge strain on our relationship. But we still persisted because of the love we share. We didn‚Äôt see each other that year and planned for a visit in 2020, little did we know of the pandemic that would shake the world and put everything on hold. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303984" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings4-1-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303985" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings5-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303986" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings6-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"> The year 2020 was really challenging for us. We hoped, prayed and believed all would work for our good. I remember there were times we both wanted to give up. Thankfully, our love sustained us. He was my IT and we weren‚Äôt willing to end everything that easily. Fast forward to November 2020, we knew we had to be together in one country- and here we are! <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303987" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings7-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303988" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings8-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303989" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings9-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303991" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings11-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="720"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303992" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings12-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303993" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings13-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303995" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings15-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1620&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1620"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303996" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Mando-Kenneth-BellaNaija-Weddings16-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1563&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1563"  data-recalc-dims="1"> Credits Makeup: @makeupbychinny
