Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has urged stakeholders in the health sector across Africa to work together and share information on sickle cell disease instead of working independently. Obasanjo, who spoke at the virtual 2nd African congress on sickle cell disease, with the theme, ‘Working to overcome sickle cell disease: What next?’ explained that working together would aid to proffer lasting solution to the dreaded disease. In a statement signed and made available to BusinessDay Sunday by Reyzie Zec-Ezekiel, Chairman African Congress Sickle Cell Disease (ACSCD), David Ajaere said it was in their best interest to review the current state of sickle cell disease in Africa and impact positively on its outcome adding , “as we gather virtually as a collective, what is our response to the growing challenge of sickle cell disease in Africa?”. The Director for World Health Organisation (WHO) – Africa region, Matshidiso Moeti who also spoke at the meeting said: “The global coalition on sickle cell disease is being established and we hope you will all join it. We are presently calling for more stakeholders from the African continent to join this global movement, from civil society organisations to private sector and government”. In the release, ACSCD International Coordinator, Eddie Resphanto observed that the creation of an African coalition would further enhance and unify their collective efforts and added that their goal was to bring ideas to the sickle cell community and push everyone to think about addressing the challenges in a different way. According to the statement, the Congress organised by Doctor Sickle Cell/Sickle Cell Disease Africa continues to be recognised as one of the most-inclusive sickle cell conferences in Africa. The 5-day event featured over 98 speakers that ranged from public health & sickle cell experts, medical practitioners, researchers, academia, advocates, governmental and non-governmental organisations including People Living With Sickle Cell Disease (PLWSCD).
