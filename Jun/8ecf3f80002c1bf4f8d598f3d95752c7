 The Scottish Premiership giants are hoping to have the 55-year-old in place in time for their pre-season training camp in Wales, which begins on July 5. However, should he arrive in Glasgow, he will through 10 days of quarantine before he could begin work. Celtic are said to have agreed compensation with Postecoglou’s current club Yokohama, although the Japanese outfit are so far refusing to comment on his potential exit. The Bhoys will also need to be granted approval by UEFA to appoint the Greek-born boss, as he does not hold the required Pro License. Sky Sports claims that the Scottish Premiership runners-up have applied to the governing body for an exemption, known as a ‘recognition of competence procedure’. To that end, they are understood to be confident that Postecoglou’s 25 years in management will see their application approved. Give our social media channels a follow – we’re on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram Postecoglou has been in charge of Yokohama since February 2018 and led them to the J-League title a year later. He has also won the Australian title with Brisbane Roar, while he led Australia to success in the 2015 Asian Cup. Celtic’s players are set to return to their Lennoxtown training ground on June 17, before a nine-day training camp in Wales. They will face Sheffield Wednesday, Charlton and Bristol City in behind-closed-doors friendlies during that trip. Celtic also enter Champions League qualifying in the second round.
