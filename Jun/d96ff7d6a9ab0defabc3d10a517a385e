  Many Nigerians have taken to social media to lambast Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for keeping mute after the suspension of Twitter operations in the country. Nigeria’s information and culture minister Lai Mohammed had on Friday announced Twitter’s suspension in a statement by his media aide, Segun Adeyemi.  <img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://i1.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/Yemi-Osinbajo.jpeg?w=1080" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1">Yemi Osinbajo   The suspension by the Nigerian government comes days after a post by President Muhammadu Buhari on the 1967 civil war was deleted by the microblogging platform. The Nigerian government’s spokesman cited “the persistent use of the platform for activities capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence” as the reason for the suspension. A check by SaharaReporters in the early hours of Saturday showed that the platform is no more active within the country. Most Twitter users on Saturday condemned the silence of Osinbajo, saying as a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and Pastor, he is expected to speak out and advise the President not to take the decision. Below are some of the reactions: I am finding it difficult to believe that VP Osinbajo signed off and endorsed this Twitter Ban. He cannot tell me that Lai Mohammed has a better leverage to convince Buhari to suspend Twitter over him. This is beyond senseless to say the least. Buhari’s advisors have no shame. — The â­mâ­nile Lawyerâ¢ (@MatthewOttah) June 5, 2021   Yemi “BDSM” Osinbajo. The man whose hands are always tied. Please don’t return to the legal profession after 2023. You have failed everyone of us who had faith in you. Absolutely failed. And you’re a disgrace to yourself, the legal profession and the body of Christ. — The Intellectual (@Osiyemi_O) June 5, 2021   Osibanjo is a wicked man. His hands are not tied; he should resign. And that’s why I stopped attending RCCG; the hypocrisy! Yemi Osibanjo is not a man of God if he’s comfortably seating amongst murderers and injustice. #TwitterBan on Saturday then preach on Sunday? ð¤¡ — ð ð S.A.L.A.K.O ð¨âð» ð (@UnkleAyo) June 5, 2021   Osibanjo is a wicked man.
