 Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, made the disclosure to state house correspondents after the meeting of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday, June 9, 2021. The meeting, which held at the presidential villa, Abuja, was presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari. Mohammed listed conditions that must be met before even considering a reversal of the Twitter ban – which includes that it must now be registered in Nigeria as a business concern, The Cable reports. He said other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram must also be registered in the country. The minister said freedom of speech was not stifled by the suspension of Twitter, adding that Nigerians can still use other platforms such as Facebook and Instagram. He added that Twitter’s loss of money as a result of the suspension is an indication of its effectiveness. Mohammed said the suspension was necessary because the micro-blogging site provided a platform for those that are threatening the existence of Nigeria. The minister alleged that Twitter allowed Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), to use its platform to call for the killing of security agents. He revealed that the microblogging platform failed to take down Kanu’s tweets despite repeated requests to do so. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone  wp-image-9259" src="https://i1.wp.com/mlpthjcvvzze.i.optimole.com/l57LFPo.2zvi~5f0f9/w:auto/h:auto/q:90/https://i0.wp.com/ebitu.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot-2021-05-05-at-1.47.18-AM.png?resize=93%2C29&#038;ssl=1" alt="EBITU | #EbituBlog" width="93" height="29" data-recalc-dims="1" data-recalc-dims="1"> The post Twitter Must be Registered in Nigeria Before Ban Will be Reversed – FG appeared first on E B I T U™.
