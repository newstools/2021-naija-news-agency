 Kane’s future could prove the biggest story of the summer transfer window, whichever way he goes. If he leaves, the England captain will likely do so for a British record fee. However, if he stays at Spurs, debate will ensure over whether he made the right decision amid his club’s long-term lack of silverware. The fee for Kane’s transfer will prove the biggest talking point; reports claim that Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy wants £150million for the 27-year-old. Manchester City have emerged as potential candidates to snap Kane up. However, while recently making a £100million bid, they noted the “availability to include players in the deal”. Winger Sterling emerged as one of five players who City could reportedly include in such a deal. Writing in his Telegraph column, though, Carragher took aim at those reports. He wrote: “I can’t believe I have read some reports suggesting he could be a makeweight in a deal to take Kane to City. “With respect, do people think Sterling is at a point in his career where he would join Spurs? Are they serious? “If he was available, top Champions League clubs would be queuing up for him.” Sterling has emerged as one of England’s heroes at Euro 2020 so far. The forward has scored both the Three Lions’ goals, which have proved to be winners in helping Gareth Southgate’s men top Group D, including Tuesday’s victory over the Czech Republic. Despite Jack Grealish and Kalvin Phillips impressing, Carragher insists that Sterling has been England’s best player at the tournament. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1965896 lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/06/22223748/Bukayo.Saka_.Gareth.Southgate.England.TEAMtalk-1.jpg" alt="Bukayo Saka;

They have exposed the folly of anyone who questioned his selection in the first place. “There were plenty of decent performers in a white shirt on Tuesday night, but – on the basis of the first three games – the quest to be England’s player of the tournament is a one-horse race.” READ MORE: Southgate singles out ‘excellent’ England man after top spot secured window.dojoRequire(["mojo/signup-forms/Loader"], function(L) { L.start({"baseUrl":"mc.us2.list-manage.com","uuid":"0dbf0c85a1d332bd7bb792371","lid":"9014791a03","uniqueMethods":true}) }) The post ‘Are they serious?’ – Carragher taken aback by key detail of Harry Kane, Man City transfer appeared first on TEAMtalk.
