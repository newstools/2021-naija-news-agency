  A former Presidential candidate, Kingsley Moghalu has said that he advised President Muhammadu Buhari to declare May 30 as a public holiday to remember the millions of Nigerians who died in the Nigerian Civil War. He stated that there are five recommendations he gave to the Nigerian leader, which include asking him to inaugurate a Truth and Reconciliation Commission that would facilitate a dialogue between the Presidency and the secessionist groups in the South East.  <img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://i2.wp.com/secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/_105254423_kingsleymoghalu.jpg?w=1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1">   Moghalu said this on his Twitter page on Monday while showing his elation that President Buhari has decided to discuss with the aggrieved separatist groups in the region. The South East has allegedly accused the Buhari-led government of marginalisation, neglect, and killings recently which have fuelled the secessionist voice especially by the Nnamdi Kanu-led Indigenous People of Biafra. Several calls have been made from the region and other parts of the country that President Buhari should encourage peace talks with these separatist groups. Reacting, the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria said he was encouraged by the decision by the President to engage in a dialogue with them. Iâm encouraged that President @MBuhari has reportedly decided to take embrace dialogue on the secessionist agitations and the security situation in the Southeast.
