Portugal would have hoped to go into their final group game knowing the result would have little bearing on their chances of progression. Yet the reality is that now a draw is required to get them through. However, the current world champions are in their way and happen to be the side they stopped from winning their home Euro 2016 tournament 5 years prior. A France side wanting revenge and unlikely to go easy despite already being through. France can confirm top of the group status with a victory and may want to avoid second spot as it could set up a match with other tournament ‘heavyweights’ England. <img class="alignnone wp-image-1498611 size-large lazyload" title="MUNICH, GERMANY - JUNE 19: Cristiano Ronaldo of Portugal scores their side's first goal past Manuel Neuer of Germany whilst under pressure from Robin Gosens of Germany during the UEFA Euro 2020 Championship Group F match between Portugal and Germany at Football Arena Munich on June 19, 2021 in Munich, Germany.

Portugal sport just 6 wins from the clashes with there being just two draws. The last time the pair met was in the Nations League in 2020. After a 0-0 in Paris, Didier Deschamps’ side travelled to Portugal and a sole N’Golo Kante goal gave France all 3 points. Prior to this was the Euro 2016 final in which Cristiano Ronaldo famously got injured early on and an extra time Eder goal sealed the unlikely win. Before this, France won the last 10 encounters dating all the way back to 1978. The odds may be against Portugal but this hasn’t stopped them in the past. <img class="alignnone wp-image-831373 size-large lazyload" title="Cristiano Ronaldo lifts the Euro 2016 trophy following the UEFA EURO 2016 Final match between Portugal and France at Stade de France on July 10, 2016 in Paris, France." src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086-1024x649.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo lifts Euro 2016 trophy with Portugal" width="1024" height="649" data-srcset="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086.jpg 1024w, https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086-768x487.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><img class="alignnone wp-image-831373 size-large lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" title="Cristiano Ronaldo lifts the Euro 2016 trophy following the UEFA EURO 2016 Final match between Portugal and France at Stade de France on July 10, 2016 in Paris, France." src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086-1024x649.jpg?resize=1024%2C649&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo lifts Euro 2016 trophy with Portugal" width="1024" height="649" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086.jpg 1024w, https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086-768x487.jpg 768w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086-1024x649.jpg?resize=1024%2C649&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img class="alignnone wp-image-831373 size-large lazyload" title="Cristiano Ronaldo lifts the Euro 2016 trophy following the UEFA EURO 2016 Final match between Portugal and France at Stade de France on July 10, 2016 in Paris, France." src="https://i0.wp.com/www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086-1024x649.jpg?resize=1024%2C649&#038;ssl=1" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo lifts Euro 2016 trophy with Portugal" width="1024" height="649" srcset="https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086.jpg 1024w, https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086-300x190.jpg 300w, https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-545947086-768x487.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"> Jules Koundé is reported to replace Benjamin Pavard on France’s right. A position he has not played and Portugal’s Diogo Jota could look to take advantage of the Sevilla player’s inexperience in the role. Ronaldo will be looking to unsettle the solid pair of Presnel Kimpembe and Raphael Varane. The Juve forward has encouraged his teammates to get balls into the box and Raphael Guerreiro and Nelson Semedo will be attacking the flanks. Portugal won the 2016 tournament thanks to their solid defence, however Ruben Dias has looked a little out of sorts compared to the player of the season tag given to the Manchester City man during his title winning Premier League year. Knowing that only a draw is needed to go through, Fernando Santos will hope Dias and Pepe can keep the team secure at the back but Karim Benzema and Kylian Mbappe will be doing all they can to break them down. <img class="alignnone wp-image-1424342 size-full lazyload" title="MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - FEBRUARY 27: Ruben Dias of Manchester City celebrates with teammate John Stones after scoring his team's first goal during the Premier League match between Manchester City and West Ham United at Etihad Stadium on February 27, 2021 in Manchester, England.

In 2016 Bayern Munich acquired the services of the highly rated central midfielder Renato Sanches. Despite the hype, Sanches could not quite earn his way into the team and was eventually sent out on loan to Swansea City where he failed again to impress. Meanwhile in the same year Bayern brought in Corentin Tolisso from Lyon. The Frenchman achieved what Sanches could not and effectively took his place in the squad. Eventually in 2019 Sanches left for Lille. Winning the title last season, Sanches re-established himself as one of Europe’s most appreciated prospects. <img class="alignnone wp-image-734031 size-large lazyload" title="SWANSEA, WALES - SEPTEMBER 10: Renato Sanches of Swansea City and Jesus Gamez of Newcastle United in action during the Premier League match between Swansea City and Newcastle United at Liberty Stadium on September 10, 2017 in Swansea, Wales.
