This will prevent the misconception that it is the State Government that makes use of council’s funds. Everybody will have the opportunity to see what comes to LGAs and how it was disbursed,” Afuape said. He said that apart from the augmentation, the State Government had also at two different occasions given grants to the Local Governments to execute people oriented projects, adding that the present administration has promised that councils in the state would not be salary paying centres only, but would also serve the needs of the people at the grassroots. Transition Committee Chairman, Odogbolu Local Government, Obafemi Onakoya, said it was expedient that the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) be improved upon, this he noted would help to lessen the dependency of councils on the Federal Government.
