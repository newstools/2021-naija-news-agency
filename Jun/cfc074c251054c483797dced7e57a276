 We’ve compared their goalscoring records for Argentina and Portugal to those of Miroslav Klose (the World Cup’s all-time top goalscorer), Gerd Muller (remarkably prolific for West Germany), Iranian icon Ali Daei (the all-time international goalscorer), Pele (Brazil’s all-time top scorer), Maradona (Argentina’s most beloved player) and Brazilian Ronaldo (who held the World Cup record before Klose). Note: we’ve included assists and minutes-per-goal for Messi, Ronaldo and Klose, because the data is available, but have omitted those stats (and penalties where unavailable) from the rest, where such data hasn’t been recorded for all of their games.
