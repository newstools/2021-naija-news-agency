As I sat in the lobby waiting to be called in for an interview, there came a dapper Haitian-American man wearing a gray bespoke suit; a pastel pink pocket square; and a large smile. In passing, the confident gentleman stopped in his tracks, extended his right hand, and said: “Welcome! My name is Maryo, what’s your name?” Being received with so much warmth, I aced the interview and impressed the Owner and the Assistant Manager. <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305212" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.33.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305209" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.30.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1>  <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305208" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.29.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305206" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.27.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1> The conversation went so well that I was offered the position the day after. Now working in Rockville, I inevitably crossed paths with my co-worker Maryo but little did I know, Maryo would be the Lead Account Executive responsible for conducting my third week of training. As I learned from his coaching, and shadowed his conversations with customers, our mutual respect quickly sprouted into deep admiration. The odds of our meeting can only be the work of the Holy Spirit. Maryo, having moved to Maryland over a year prior, was known to jokingly say: “I’m moving to DC to find my Afrocentric queen”. What was once a humorous fantasy became true. So as I shine, Maryo is inescapably soaked in my vibrant energy. <img src="https://i0.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f92d.png?w=1080&ssl=1" alt=🤭 class=wp-smiley style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims=1> <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305207" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.28.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305204" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.25.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1>  <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305201" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.22.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1>  <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305200" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.21.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305198" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.19.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305199" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.20.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1> The proposal story,by Groom, Maryo: On June 29th, 2019, Yinka and her family travelled 8 hours north to a small town in Massachusetts to celebrate my mother’s birthday. Through this small town flows the Nashua River where you can find Yinka’s favourite park called the Wachusett Reservoir. Near the body of water hides this picturesque park where we have visited several times in the past, being nature lovers. This park is Yinka’s favourite hidden gem in Central Massachusetts because of fresh air, clean water, nature photographers, painters, and friendly hikers. However that day, this visit was for an entirely different reason. <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305184" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.05.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305185" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.06.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1> n. <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305195" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.16.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305194" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.15.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1> The Plan: Days before my mom’s birthday celebration, I had cleverly gathered both sides of the family to wait for Yinka at the center of the park. At the centre of the Wachusett Reservoir park, there’s a fountain surrounded by oak and maple trees – which draws in the perfect spot to gather both families. I had each family member holding a red rose and patiently waited behind each tree for Yinka’s arrival. <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305186" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.07.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305189" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.10.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1>  <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305193" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.14.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305192" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.13.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1> I convinced Yinka to enjoy a light stroll toward the edge of the water where the shooting fountain is reflecting a rainbow. As Yinka approaches the spraying water, her youngest sister – previously hidden behind a surrounded tree – slowly walks towards Yinka with a single rose. <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305190" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.11.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305187" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.08.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1> Confused, Yinka nervously grabs the rose, completely unaware that each family member was hidden behind an oak tree waiting their turn. Seconds later, another sister approaches her with another flower and hands it to Yinka. Shortly thereafter, another sister appears, then her mother, then my brothers, then my mom, etc. <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305197" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.18.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305196" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.17.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1> As each loved one gave Yinka a rose, they whisper kind words like: “Congratulations!”, “God bless you!”, “I’m so happy for you”, “welcome to our family”, “Thank you for catering to my son” and etc. Before long, Yinka had a dozen roses clutched in her hand. She blushingly thanks everyone and gleefully turns towards me to tell me how sweet of a gesture this was… <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305213" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.34.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305216" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.37.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305217" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.38.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1> Only to discover that I was nowhere to be found. Confused, Yinka turns around and sees me already kneeling and extending out the ring of her dreams, a massive emerald-cut diamond ring! Both families explode with joy as Yinka hears the words: “Let’s unite our family together. Yinka, will you be my wife?” <img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305218" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.39.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305202" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.23.jpg?resize=1002%2C1500&ssl=1" alt width=1002 height=1500 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305215" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.36.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1><img loading=lazy class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305214" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Yinka-Maryo-TheBrunoBond-Prewedding-BellaNaija-Weddings.35.jpg?resize=1080%2C721&ssl=1" alt width=1080 height=721 data-recalc-dims=1>   Credits Bride: @yinkaoladiranGroom: @maryomotivationPlanner: @ftkkonnect @webbyftkPhotography: @judahavenue The post It’s a Nigerian-Haitian Love Story!
