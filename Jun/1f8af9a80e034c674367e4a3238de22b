 The 19-year-old will fall out of contract at the end of June and there are no shortage of suitors for the Portugal Under-19 star. Tavares is a product of the Foxes academy, having moved to the East Midlands at the age of nine. His signed his first professional contract in 2019 and has made three senior appearances to date. With all the talent at Brandan Rodgers’ disposal, it is tough for a youngster to break into the first team. But he made his debut in February this year as late substitute in the 2-0 Europa League defeat to Slavia Prague. He was then handed a Premier League debut, playing the final 13 minutes of Leicester’s 1-1 draw with Burnley on March 3. And he went one better three days later, starting for the first time as the Foxes beat Brighton 2-1 at the Amex. Rodgers clearly rated the starlet as he was full of praise for his display against the Seagulls. “Sidnei Tavares was excellent. Technically he’s very good. I felt we needed that player who can take the ball and pass it forward,” he said after the game. “It was a nice 70 minutes for him. He’s a talent. “He needs to get more physical in the game. He loves the ball, that’s the type of player I like. He nearly scored a great goal. There’s a great opportunity here for him if he continues to work and keeps his head down and doesn’t get carried away.” It is thought that club officials want to offer him fresh terms but they cannot hang around. Having invested so much time in Tavares it would be strange if he was now let go. Rodgers has stated that the club were in talks with his representatives over a contract extension. But the trail has gone cold and there has been no word on progress. And, according to Inter Live (via Sport Witness), he is ‘very popular’ at Inter Milan and they are ‘very interested’ in signing the player. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-1953763 size-large" src="https://i1.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Brendan.Rodgers.2021.TEAMtalk31-1024x538-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C538&#038;ssl=1" alt="Brendan.Rodgers.2021.TEAMtalk31" width="1024" height="538" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/naijanewsagency.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Brendan.Rodgers.2021.TEAMtalk31-1024x538-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C538&#038;ssl=1 1024w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/05/15195441/Brendan.Rodgers.2021.TEAMtalk31-300x158.jpg 300w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/05/15195441/Brendan.Rodgers.2021.TEAMtalk31-768x403.jpg 768w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/05/15195441/Brendan.Rodgers.2021.TEAMtalk31-200x105.jpg 200w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/05/15195441/Brendan.Rodgers.2021.TEAMtalk31-170x90.jpg 170w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/05/15195441/Brendan.Rodgers.2021.TEAMtalk31-128x67.jpg 128w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/05/15195441/Brendan.Rodgers.2021.TEAMtalk31-700x367.jpg 700w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/05/15195441/Brendan.Rodgers.2021.TEAMtalk31-469x245.jpg 469w, https://d3vlf99qeg6bpx.cloudfront.net/content/uploads/2021/05/15195441/Brendan.Rodgers.2021.TEAMtalk31-236x124.jpg 236w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-recalc-dims="1"> But the Serie A champions are not alone, as city rivals AC Milan have also been mentioned in connection with the schemer.
