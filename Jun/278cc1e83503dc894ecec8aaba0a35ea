  Nigeria’s Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, has defied the Nigerian government’s Twitter ban. Nigerian government banned Twitter last Friday after the App deleted a controversial comment made by President Muhammadu Buhari, in which he made reference to the Nigerian Civil War, which many Nigerians described as distasteful.  <img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://i1.wp.com/saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/abubakar-malami-e1595592563974.jpg?w=1080" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1">   The Kaduna state governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, a staunch supporter of the present regime, also tweeted on Sunday despite the ban. Amidst the public outcry and criticism that followed the government’s decision, Malami had on Saturday directed the Director of Public Prosecutions in his office to begin the process of prosecuting violators of the government suspension order. Despite his threat, many Nigerians have been using Virtual Private Networks to access Twitter. In a post on his verified Facebook page on Tuesday, the Attorney General posted a screenshot from the Twitter app showing his account has been deleted. “My Twitter account deactivated,” he wrote.  However, checks by SaharaReporters showed that a Twitter account can’t be deactivated unless you have access to the app, meaning Malami must have logged in to deactivate it.
