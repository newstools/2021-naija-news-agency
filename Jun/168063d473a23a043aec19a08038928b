Ilana Omo Oodua, a group, agitating for a sovereign Yoruba nation, stormed the state capital to continue its support rally in all the Southwest States.  <img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/WhatsApp Image 2021-06-05 at 13.19.27.jpeg?itok=eXOC7cqs" alt="">   Vehicular traffic was diverted from the busy Fajuyi park/flyover. Pictures of hundreds of the agitators with placards were seen by SaharaReporters on Saturday afternoon. There was also a heavy presence of security operatives including police, Department of State Services and Amotekun Corps at the venue, a witness said.  <img class="media-element file-embedded" typeof="foaf:Image" src="http://saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/WhatsApp Image 2021-06-05 at 13.15.04.jpeg?itok=8NPsWIpe" alt="">   One of the agitators and member of the Oodua Action Movement, Olusola Oyemakinde, said, “We are here in support of the agitation for Oodua nation. Every one of us can see the state of Nigeria whereby there is no justice. There is lopsidedness and insecurity is the order of the day. “The government of Nigeria has failed in its responsibility of securing lives. We cannot continue this way. The Yoruba nation is the answer for us.”  ACTIVISM Politics  News  AddThis :  Original Author : SaharaReporters, New York  Disable advertisements :
