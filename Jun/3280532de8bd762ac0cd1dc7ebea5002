 Sometime in 2016, Dami slid into the DMs of the beautiful damsel, Aisha. They were both on two different continents at the time and this probably would have been enough grounds for things not to go loveâ€™s way. But trust love to always find a way! So, platforms like Instagram to the rescue. <img src="https://i2.wp.com/s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png?w=1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="ðŸ˜‰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" data-recalc-dims="1"> Well, here we are years later, loving the sweetness of their pre-wedding shoot, thanks to that single DM.

By bride-to-be, Aisha: Dami and I met in 2016. I was doing my masterâ€™s program in the UK at the time and he messaged me on Instagram. We grew fond of each other and when I finally got back to Lagos, Nigeria we decided to meet up. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305073" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings9.jpg?resize=1080%2C1619&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1619"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305072" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings7.jpg?resize=1080%2C1619&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1619"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305071" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings6-scaled.jpg?resize=1080%2C1542&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1542"  data-recalc-dims="1">  <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305070" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings5.jpg?resize=1080%2C1592&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1592"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305078" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings14.jpg?resize=1080%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="720"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305076" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings12.jpg?resize=1080%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="720"  data-recalc-dims="1"> He was living in Abuja but he came down to Lagos to see me one afternoon while I was at the salon. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305077" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings13.jpg?resize=1080%2C1619&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1619"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305074" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings10.jpg?resize=1080%2C1619&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1619"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305075" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings11.jpg?resize=1080%2C720&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="720"  data-recalc-dims="1"> At first, I thought he was joking about coming down because we didnâ€™t discuss any of that and it was sudden. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305084" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings19.jpg?resize=1080%2C1619&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1619"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305083" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings18.jpg?resize=1080%2C1619&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1619"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305082" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings17.jpg?resize=1080%2C1619&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1619"  data-recalc-dims="1"> That special day led to a whirlwind of dates and into a love that neither of us expected.Â  Dami eventually proposed on June 12, 2020. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305081" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings16.jpg?resize=1080%2C1619&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1619"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305086" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings21.jpg?resize=1080%2C1619&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1619"  data-recalc-dims="1"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1305085" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bellanaijaweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Aisha-Dami-BellaNaija-Weddings20.jpg?resize=1080%2C1619&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="1080" height="1619"  data-recalc-dims="1"> Weâ€™re both excited to start the next phase of their lives together and canâ€™t wait to celebrate on June 12 which happens to be my birthday!!
