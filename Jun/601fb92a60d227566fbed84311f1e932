  The Kano State Hisbah Board says it has arrested a young man identified as Muhammad Ikbal who stopped praying and going to the mosque after operatives of the Islamic police shaved his hair. Sharing the photos of Mohammed, Hisbah Commander-in-Chief, Ustaz Harun Muhammad Sani Ibn Sina, urged him to desist from further immoral act.  <img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload" typeof="foaf:Image" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/AB9709EA-4D5C-4218-A966-4FD4F1367D40.jpeg?itok=QIgUYuHj" alt=""><img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload jetpack-lazy-image" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://i0.wp.com/secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/AB9709EA-4D5C-4218-A966-4FD4F1367D40.jpeg?w=1080&#038;ssl=1" alt data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/AB9709EA-4D5C-4218-A966-4FD4F1367D40.jpeg?w=1080&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><noscript><img class="media-element file-embedded lazyload" typeof="foaf:Image" src="https://i0.wp.com/secure.saharareporters.com/sites/default/files/styles/normal_medium/public/AB9709EA-4D5C-4218-A966-4FD4F1367D40.jpeg?w=1080&#038;ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1">   Ibn Sina further instructed him to go and do a Nafl prayer and ask God for forgiveness. A Nafil prayer or supererogatory prayer also known as Nawafil prayers is a type of optional Muslim formal worship. They are not considered obligatory but are thought to confer extra benefit on the person performing them. Ibn Sina had in an audio message obtained by SaharaReporters last week said the commission was looking for Mohammed for violating Islamic law. The young guy had in a trending video claimed he stopped praying after Hisbah operatives shaved off his long hair for being ‘unIslamic’. Despite condemnation from Nigerians, the Hisbah group has continued its push for the Islamic agenda in the North. The agency, established to enforce Sharia law in some states in the region, recently banned stylish haircuts, sagging of trousers, playing of music at social events by disk jockeys and tricycle riders from adorning their vehicles with pictures considered to be obscene and against the tenents of Islam. A barber and his customers were also arrested recently for giving and having haircuts respectively, considered to be offensive to Islam. They are also notorious for destroying truckloads of alcoholic drinks. Also, in March, Hisbah operatives arrested two men suspected of sending pornographic materials to a married woman. The suspects were traced and arrested after the woman complained to the board. Islam News  AddThis :  Original Author : SaharaReporters, New York  Disable advertisements :
